/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2725," I examine the dynamics of oligopolies when firms derive subjective value from market leadership. In equilibrium, prices alternate in tandem between high levels and occasional price wars, which take place when market leadership is at stake. The stationary distribution of market shares is typically multimodal; that is, much of the time, there is a stable market leader. Even though shareholders do not value market leadership per se, a corporate culture that values market leadership may increase shareholder value.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.46.12.1513.12076," It is known that end users of products and services sometimes innovate, and that innovations developed by users sometimes become the basis for important newcommercial products and services. It has also been argued and to some extent shown that such innovations will be found concentrated in a “lead user” segment of the user community. However, neither the characteristics of innovating users nor the scope of the community that they “lead” has been explored in depth. In this paper, we explore the characteristics of innovation, innovators, and innovation sharing by library users of OPAC information search systems in Australia. This market has capable users, but it is nonetheless clearly a “follower” with respect to worldwide technological advance. Wefind that 26% of users in this local market nonetheless do modify their OPACs in both major and minor ways, and that OPAC manufacturers judge many of these user modifications to be of commercial interest. We find that we can distinguish modifying from nonmodifying users on the basis of a number of factors, including their “leading-edge status” and their in-house technical capabilities. We find that many innovating users freely share their innovations with others, and find that we can distinguish users that share information about their modifications from users that do not. We conclude by considering some implications of our findings for idea generation practices in marketing."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2986," We study how information sharing within an organization affects individual performance. We look at situations in which the same analyst, while working at the same broker, covers multiple mergers and acquisitions (M&As), in particular the acquirer prior to the M&A and the merged firm thereafter. We find that earnings forecasts for the merged firm are significantly more accurate when the analyst has a colleague (working at the same broker) covering the target prior to the M&A. This holds particularly true if acquirer analysts and target analysts reside in the same locale, if they are part of a smaller team, and if the target analyst is of higher quality. Our findings highlight the importance of information spillovers on individual performance in knowledge-based industries. This paper was accepted by Amit Seru, finance."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2020.0946," Problem Definition : This study examines whether and how the relationship between technology licensing and productivity growth in the short run is affected by the challenges and constraints inherent in the contexts in which developing economy firms operate. We do so by investigating the moderating role of formal workforce training program in a firm and the corruption level and the infrastructural constraint level in the firm's external environment. Academic/Practical Relevance : Although the adoption of foreign technology by developing economy manufacturing firms is often driven by the goal to strengthen their capabilities in the long run, prior research provides a limited understanding of the performance consequences of technology licensing in the short run, which is an important business reality. Our study serves to address this important gap in research and practice. Methodology : The empirical analyses are conducted using matching and fixed-effects regression on a multi-industry dataset from the World Bank. We analyze detailed firm-level information from over 16,000 manufacturing firms across 25 developing economies in South Asia and East Asia. To strengthen causal inference, our analyses address selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity. Results : Our results indicate that the adoption of foreign technology by developing economy manufacturing firms has a substantial short-run disruptive effect on firm operations with productivity growth declining by 4.5 percentage points in these firms relative to comparable firms that do not use foreign technology licensing. We find that formal workforce training programs attenuate the negative relationship between technology licensing and productivity growth. However, infrastructural constraints in the external business environment amplify this negative relationship. Intriguingly, our results suggest that corruption in the firm's external environment acts as an “efficient grease,” attenuating the negative impact of technology licensing on productivity growth. Managerial Implications : Our results provide compelling evidence regarding the disruptive effects of technology licensing on productivity growth in the short run. Furthermore, these results offer insights for manufacturing firms and policymakers in developing economies on how to mitigate these negative effects."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2018.3190," Our dynamic model of information technology (IT) outsourcing integrates incomplete contracts, moral hazard, and adverse selection under both perfect and, more realistically, bounded rationality. In addition to the classical profit-maximizing firm unconstrained by ethics, we model an ethically constrained (but otherwise profit-maximizing) firm that honors its contractual obligations irrespective of legal restraints. We prove that under bounded rationality, the ethically constrained firm can obtain strictly greater profits than the unconstrained profit-maximizing firm, even when (i) the unconstrained firm has access to a superset of the ethical firm’s strategies and (ii) the ethical firm is unable to reveal its ethical commitment to its contracting partner anytime during the contractual relationship. Thus, a commitment to ethics, while of course being morally desirable, can lead to higher profits than the unbridled profit-maximization of classical economics. We also prove that ethics is foundational to both intellectual property (IP) sharing and reputation effects , two well-known facilitators of IT outsourcing. In fact, the mere possibility of ethical firms (a) forces across-the-board IP sharing even if it lowers profits and (b) induces even an ethically unconstrained firm to invest in developing a reputation for ethics. Our model provides a novel explanation, rooted in ethics, for why IT outsourcing is booming despite the formidable impediments of incomplete contracts, moral hazard, and adverse selection.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.49.11.1580.20580," We present a framework and empirical estimates that quantify the economic impact of increased product variety made available through electronic markets. While efficiency gains from increased competition significantly enhance consumer surplus, for instance, by leading to lower average selling prices, our present research shows that increased product variety made available through electronic markets can be a significantly larger source of consumer surplus gains. One reason for increased product variety on the Internet is the ability of online retailers to catalog, recommend, and provide a large number of products for sale. For example, the number of book titles available at Amazon.com is more than 23 times larger than the number of books on the shelves of a typical Barnes & Noble superstore, and 57 times greater than the number of books stocked in a typical large independent bookstore. Our analysis indicates that the increased product variety of online bookstores enhanced consumer welfare by $731 million to $1.03 billion in the year 2000, which is between 7 and 10 times as large as the consumer welfare gain from increased competition and lower prices in this market. There may also be large welfare gains in other SKU-intensive consumer goods such as music, movies, consumer electronics, and computer software and hardware."
/doi/10.1287/opre.2018.1792," Gleaning programs organize volunteer gleaners to harvest a variety of leftover crops that are donated by farmers for the purpose of feeding food-insecure individuals. Thus, the gleaning process simultaneously reduces food waste and food insecurity. However, the operationalization of this process is challenging because gleaning relies on two uncertain sources of input: the food and labor supplies. The purpose of this paper is to help gleaning organizations increase the (value-weighted) volume of fresh food gleaned by better managing the uncertainties in the gleaning operation. We develop a model to capture the uncertainties in food and labor supplies and seek a dynamic volunteer-staffing policy that maximizes the payoff associated with the amount of food gleaned. The exact analysis of the staffing problem seems intractable. Therefore, we resort to an approximation in the heavy traffic regime. In that regime, we characterize the system dynamics of the multicrop gleaning operation and derive the optimal staffing policy in closed form. The optimal policy is a nested threshold policy that specifies the staffing level for each class of donation (i.e., a donation of a particular crop type and donation size). The policy depends on the number of available gleaners and the backlog of gleaning donations. A numerical study using data calibrated from a gleaning organization in the Boston area shows that the dynamic staffing policy we propose can recover approximately 10% of the volume lost when the gleaning organization uses a static policy. To achieve this improvement, no capital or major process changes would be required—only some small changes to the staffing level requests.

/doi/10.1287/msom.2016.0598," Competing technologies in emerging industries create uncertainties that discourage supplier investments. Open technology can induce supplier investments, but may also lead to intensified future competition. In this paper, we study competing manufacturers’ open-technology strategies. We show that despite the risk of intensifying future competition, open technologies by competing manufacturers may constitute an equilibrium and can indeed induce supplier investments. In addition, we identify a technology-risk-pooling benefit; namely, by opening technologies, competing manufacturers can induce supplier investments in both technologies and later adopt the one preferred by the market. However, manufacturers may also exhibit the prisoner’s dilemma and close their technologies despite the risk-pooling benefit. In this case, there is potential for collaborative technology sharing through cross licensing. Finally, we show that manufacturers may sometimes close their technologies to force supplier investments."
/doi/10.1287/deca.1120.0247," We study a problem where a new, unfamiliar group of agents has to decide how a joint reward should be shared among them. We focus on settings where the share that each agent receives depends on the evaluations of its peers concerning that agent's contribution to the group. We introduce a mechanism to elicit and aggregate evaluations as well as for determining agents' shares. The intuition behind the proposed mechanism is that each agent has its expected share maximized to the extent that it is well evaluated by its peers and that it is truthfully reporting its evaluations. For promoting truthfulness, the proposed mechanism uses a peer-prediction method built on strictly proper scoring rules. Under the assumption that agents are Bayesian decision makers, we show that our mechanism is incentive compatible and budget balanced. We also provide sufficient conditions under which the proposed mechanism is individually rational, resistant to some kinds of collusion, and fair."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2021.1058," This paper provides the first large-scale evidence of business-to-customer racial bias (B2C bias) on a digital platform, on which the perpetrators are individual employees who act on behalf of a company and the victims are customers. This is in contrast to existing studies of racial bias on digital platforms that focus on peer-to-peer marketplaces (e.g., eBay), in which both the perpetrators and the victims are individuals acting independently and on their own behalf. In particular, we present the first evidence of B2C bias in corporate social media customer service, a practice that has grown in popularity recently. Unlike traditional call centers, agents providing customer service on social media respond, on average, to fewer than half of the complaints they receive as per our analysis. We investigate the effect of a complaining customer’s racial identity, as revealed by the social media profile picture, on the chance of receiving a response. By analyzing more than 57,000 social media customer complaints to major U.S. airlines and leveraging a variety of analytics techniques, including text mining and facial recognition, we present quantitative evidence that African American customers are less likely to receive a response when they complain than otherwise similar White customers. Furthermore, our deep learning–based falsification test shows that the bias is absent without the visual cue that reveals racial identity. This study offers a practical yet powerful recommendation for companies: conceal all customer profile pictures from their employees while delivering social media customer service."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2020.0886," Problem definition : We analyze a contract in which a supplier who is exposed to disruption risk offers a supply-flexibility contract comprising of a wholesale price and a minimum-delivery fraction (“flexibility” fraction) to a buyer facing random demand. The supplier is allowed to deviate below the order quantity by at most the flexibility fraction. The supplier’s regular production is subject to random disruption, but she has access to a reliable expedited supply source at a higher marginal cost. Academic/practical relevance : Despite the prevalence of supply-flexibility contracts in practice, to the best of our knowledge, there is no previous academic literature examining the optimal design of supply-flexibility contracts. As such, the level of flexibility in practice is usually set on an ad-hoc basis, with buyers typically reluctant to share risk with suppliers. Our analysis of supply-flexibility contracts informs practice in two ways: First, using analytically supported arguments, it educates managers on the effects of their decisions on the economic outcomes. Second, it shows that the supply-flexibility contract benefits both the supplier and the buyer, regardless of which player chooses how supply risk is allocated in the supply chain. Methodology : Non-cooperative game theory, non-convex optimization. Results : We derive the supplier-led optimal contract and show that supply chain efficiency improves relative to the price-only contract. More interestingly, even though the buyer lets the supplier decide how the two share supply risk, profits of both the players increase by the introduction of flexibility into the contract. Further, supply flexibility may be even more valuable for the buyer compared with the supplier. Interestingly, the flexibility fraction is not monotone in supplier reliability and a more reliable supplier may even prefer to transfer more risk to the buyer. The robustness of these findings is established on two extensions: one where we study a buyer-led contract (i.e., the buyer chooses the flexibility fraction) and the other where the expedited supply option is available to both the supplier and the buyer. Managerial implications : The supply-flexibility contract is mutually beneficial for both players and yet retains all the advantages of the price-only contract—it is easy to implement, it requires minimal operational and administrative burden, and there is evidence of the use of such contracts in practice. While our focus is not on supply chain coordination, we note that the combination of two mechanisms—the supply-flexibility contract derived in this paper to share supply risk and a buyback contract to share demand risk—yields a coordinating contract."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2956," How does a firm decide whether to employ professionals and control how they deliver services to clients, or to operate as a platform enabling independent professionals to provide services directly to clients? Similarly, how does a manufacturer decide whether to allow sales agents to choose certain costly actions (e.g., kickbacks to clients) or to take control of these actions itself? We answer this question using a principal–agent framework in which both the principal and the agent must be incentivized to carry out investments (or effort) that increase the revenue they jointly create. Our theory explains when the principal should take control over a particular decision (“control”) or should instead allow the agent to make the decision (“enable”). It does so both for the case when there are multiple such transferable decisions for a single agent, and for the case when there are many agents and one transferable decision for each. We also consider the possibility of cost asymmetries between the principal and the agent, spillovers across agents, and the misclassification of the principal as an employer even though agents are allocated the relevant control rights. Finally, we explain how the “control versus enable” choice and its associated trade-offs differ from the classic “make versus buy” choice.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2749," We examine why buy-side analysts share investment ideas on SumZero.com, a private social networking website designed to facilitate interaction and information sharing among buy-side professionals. We explore labor market motivations for information sharing and document that analysts with strong incentives to build a reputation (i.e., those who did not attend a top 10 university and those employed at small funds) are significantly more likely to share recommendations. Our findings indicate that analysts who share ideas are more likely to change jobs and that the likelihood of employment change is positively related to the ratings provided by peers. We also document that analyst recommendations generate significant returns when they are posted on SumZero and that prices drift in the direction of the recommendation. Long-window returns are particularly strong for contrarian buy recommendations and for most sell recommendations. Overall, we show that buy-side analysts share valuable private information in an online social network and that this can be an effective reputation-building and job-seeking tool.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.48.10.1314.271," Scale economies are commonplace in operations, yet because of analytical challenges, relatively little is known about how firms should compete in their presence. This paper presents a model of competition between two firms that face scale economies; (i.e., each firm's cost per unit of demand is decreasing in demand). A general framework is used, which incorporates competition between two service providers with price- and time-sensitive demand (a queuing game), and competition between two retailers with fixed-ordering costs and pricesensitive consumers (an Economic Order Quantity game). Reasonably general conditions are provided under which there exists at most one equilibrium, with both firms participating in the market. We demonstrate, in the context of the queuing game, that the lower cost firm in equilibrium may have a higher market share and a higher price, an enviable situation. We also allow each firm to outsource their production process to a supplier. Even if the supplier's technology is no better than the firms' technology and the supplier is required to establish dedicated capacity (so the supplier's scale can be no greater than either firm's scale), we show that the firms strictly prefer to outsource. We conclude that scale economies provide a strong motivation for outsourcing that has not previously been identified in the literature."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1472," This paper argues that conflicting incentives among managers may impede potential knowledge-sharing benefits from vertical integration. I study knowledge-based agency costs from vertical integration in car leasing, where manufacturer-owned captive lessors compete with independent lessors. Both organizational forms must acquire and integrate diffuse knowledge to accurately predict vehicle depreciation—a condition critical for profitability. Using a data set of 180,000 leases, I compare contracts of independent and captive lessors across car models, market conditions, and product life cycles. I find that managers in vertically integrated firms have conflicting incentives on whether to accurately and completely share proprietary knowledge, and show that these incentives appear to generate agency costs inconsistent with corporate profitability as managers selectively use and share knowledge for personal gain. The findings suggest that most knowledge benefits of vertical integration will be nullified when managerial interests are incompatible with the profit concerns of the firm.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3303," Just as employers face uncertainty when hiring workers, workers also face uncertainty when accepting employment, and bad employers may opportunistically depart from expectations, norms, and laws. However, prior research in economics and information sciences has focused sharply on the employer’s problem of identifying good workers rather than vice versa. This issue is especially pronounced in markets for gig work, including online labor markets, in which platforms are developing strategies to help workers identify good employers. We build a theoretical model for the value of such reputation systems and test its predictions on Amazon Mechanical Turk, on which employers may decline to pay workers while keeping their work product and workers protect themselves using third-party reputation systems, such as Turkopticon. We find that (1) in an experiment on worker arrival, a good reputation allows employers to operate more quickly and on a larger scale without loss to quality; (2) in an experimental audit of employers, working for good-reputation employers pays 40% higher effective wages because of faster completion times and lower likelihoods of rejection; and (3) exploiting reputation system crashes, the reputation system is particularly important to small, good-reputation employers, which rely on the reputation system to compete for workers against more established employers. This is the first clean field evidence of the effects of employer reputation in any labor market and is suggestive of the special role that reputation-diffusing technologies can play in promoting gig work, in which conventional labor and contract laws are weak.

/doi/10.1287/isre.1120.0430," In recent years, with the emergence and growth of illegal file sharing on the Internet, individual piracy of digital goods, i.e., consumers making illegal copies on their own rather than relying on purchasing copies from commercial pirates, has stirred substantial controversy. Threatened by this growth, the information goods industry took legal action by suing the file sharing peer-to-peer networks and the consumers who illegally share copyrighted material on these networks. In this paper we demonstrate that each one of these two actions aimed to fight individual piracy can backfire by providing strategic disadvantage to legal publishers of information goods. In particular, we show that in the presence of commercial piracy (i) a higher population of consumers who are capable of individual piracy can increase a legal publisher's profits; and (ii) a higher detection and prosecution rate for individual piracy can reduce a legal publisher's profits. Both effects can be observed in markets where commercial piracy is suppressed because the legal publisher can be coerced to take a price cut to minimize the loss of market share. The latter effect can also be observed in markets with active commercial piracy presence because the legal publisher can be forced to raise prices and concede market share to piracy. Our results suggest that information goods producers may be better off by considering their copyright protection policies concerning individual piracy from a more strategic point of view."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.1080.0369," Choice-based conjoint analysis is a popular marketing research technique to learn about consumers' preferences and to make market share forecasts under various scenarios for product offerings. Managers expect these forecasts to be “realistic” in terms of being able to replicate market shares at some prespecified or “base-case” scenario. Frequently, there is a discrepancy between the recovered and base-case market share. This paper presents a Bayesian decision theoretic approach to incorporating base-case market shares into conjoint analysis via the loss function. Because defining the base-case scenario typically involves a variety of management decisions, we treat the market shares as constraints on what are acceptable answers, as opposed to informative prior information. Our approach seeks to minimize the adjustment of parameters by using additive factors from a normal distribution centered at 0, with a variance as small as possible, but such that the market share constraints are satisfied. We specify an appropriate loss function, and all estimates are formally derived via minimizing the posterior expected loss. We detail algorithms that provide posterior distributions of constrained and unconstrained parameters and quantities of interest. The methods are demonstrated using discrete choice models with simulated data and data from a commercial market research study. These studies indicate that the method recovers base-case market shares without systematically distorting the preference structure from the conjoint experiment."
/doi/10.1287/serv.2021.0281," Events in the year 2020 threw human service systems into chaotic states, threatening peoples’ lives and livelihoods. Before 2020, there were many profound challenges to human life that had been well documented by efforts such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The COVID-19 pandemic seems to be a “last straw” crisis that has destabilized modern human civilization. This article diagnoses various crises of human service systems (e.g., COVID-19, inequality, and climate change) and proposes the metaphor of service ecosystem health for reimagining service science in a postpandemic world. Service ecosystem health is defined as the interdependent state of private, public, and planetary well-being necessary for sustaining life. This article reimagines service science, broadens transformative service research, builds the service ecosystem health metaphor, outlines the Goldilocks Civilization thought experiment, and explores designing for a Goldilocks civilization. Because service is for humans, the ultimate objective is to elevate service science to uplift human well-being."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1905," Whether and how trust and trustworthiness differ between a collectivist society, e.g., China, and an individualistic one, e.g., the United States, generates much ongoing scientific debate and bears significant practical values for managing cross-country transactions. We experimentally investigate how supply chain members' countries of origin—China versus the United States—affect trust, trustworthiness, and strategic information sharing behavior in a cross-country supply chain. We consider a two-tier supply chain in which the upstream supplier solicits demand forecast information from the retailer to plan production; but the retailer has an incentive to manipulate her forecast to ensure abundant supply. The levels of trust and trustworthiness in the supply chain and supplier's capability to determine the optimal production quantity affect the efficacy of forecast sharing and the resulting profits. We develop an experimental design to disentangle these three aspects and to allow for real-time interactions between geographically distant and culturally heterogeneous participants. We observe that, when there is no prospect for long-term interactions, our Chinese participants consistently exhibit lower spontaneous trust and trustworthiness than their U.S. counterparts do. We quantify the differences in trust and trustworthiness between the two countries, and the resulting impact on supply chain efficiency. We also show that Chinese individuals exhibit higher spontaneous trust toward U.S. partners than Chinese ones, primarily because they perceive that individuals from the United States are more trusting and trustworthy in general. This positive perception toward U.S. people is indeed consistent with the U.S. participants' behavior in forecast sharing. In addition, we quantify that a Chinese supply chain enjoys a larger efficiency gain from repeated interactions than a U.S. one does, as the prospect of building a long-term relationship successfully sustains trust and trustworthiness by Chinese partners. We advocate that companies can reinforce the positive perception of westerners held by the Chinese population and commit to long-term relationships to encourage trust by Chinese partners. Finally, we also observe that both populations exhibit similar pull-to-center bias when solving a decision problem under uncertainty (i.e., the newsvendor problem).

/doi/10.1287/orsc.2020.1417," This study develops a theory of due diligence in corporate acquisitions. Using a formal model, the study situates due diligence in the context of economies of scope, which are often sought by acquiring organizations that have incomplete information about such economies. Relatedness, the key determinant of economies of scope, and ambiguity, the key determinant of incomplete information, are used to derive the optimal due diligence effort and the returns to an acquiring organization that result from that effort. The derived predictions qualify both the general appeal to extensive due diligence and the general recognition of the costliness of due diligence. These predictions can be tested in future empirical research on corporate acquisitions and may guide corporate acquirers on the optimal allocation of their due diligence efforts in the mergers and acquisitions market."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.47.4.579.9826," The emergence of carriers that deliver items to geographically dispersed destinations quickly and at a reasonable cost, combined with the low cost of sharing information through networked databases, has opened up new opportunities to better manage inventory. We investigate these benefits in the context of a supply chain in which a manufacturer supplies expensive, low-demand items to vertically integrated or autonomous retailers via one central depot. The manufacturer's lead time is assumed to be due to the geographical distance from the market or a combination of low volumes, high variety, and inflexible production processes. We formulate and solve an appropriate mathematical model based on one-for-one inventory policies in which a replenishment order is placed as soon as the customer withdraws an item. We find that sharing and transshipment of items often, but not always, reduces the overall costs of holding, shipping, and waiting for inventory. Unexpectedly, these cost reductions are sometimes achieved through increasing overall inventory levels in the supply chain. Finally, while sharing of inventory typically benefits all the participants in decentralized supply chains, this is not necessarily the case—sharing can hurt the distributor or individual retailers, regardless of their relative power in the supply chain."

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0700," This paper studies how judicious resource allocation in networks mitigates risk. Theory is presented for general utility functions and mean-variance formulations and is illustrated with networks featuring resource diversification, flexibility (e.g., inventory substitution), and sharing (commonality). In contrast to single-resource settings, risk-averse newsvendors may invest more in networks than risk-neutral newsvendors: some resources and even total spending may exceed risk-neutral levels. With normally distributed demand, risk-averse newsvendors change resource levels roughly proportionally to demand variance, while risk-neutral agents adjust only proportionally to standard deviation. Two effects explain this operational hedge and suggest rules of thumb for strategic placement of safety capacity and inventory in networks: (1) Risk pooling suggests rebalancing capacity toward inexpensive resources that serve lower-profit variance markets. This highlights the role of profit variance (instead of demand variance) in risk-averse network investment. (2) Ex post revenue maximization suggests rebalancing capacity toward substitutable flexible but away from shared capacity when markets differ in profitability. Capacity imbalance and allocation flexibility thus mitigate profit risk and truly are operational hedges."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.1110.0641," The critical role of research and development (R&D) and advertising in the marketing strategy of the firm is well established. This paper conceptually and empirically examines why and how much the effectiveness of these two marketing instruments differs between times of economic expansions versus periods of economic contractions—and whether these results depend on the cyclicality of the industry in question. We consider a key marketing metric (market share) and a key financial metric (firm profit). Our empirical setting is 1,175 U.S. firms across a time period spanning over three decades. We find that R&D and advertising contribute to firm performance but that their effectiveness is not constant across the business cycle. Increasing advertising share in contractions has a stronger effect on profit and market share than increasing advertising share in expansions. Likewise, investments in R&D in contractions lead to higher gains in market share and profit than R&D investments in expansions, albeit only in subsequent years. If in contractions the firm faces tight budget constraints and has to choose between either maintaining R&D or advertising, our simulation results show that maintaining R&D is associated with better company performance. We find that advertising effectiveness, in general, and in contractions, in particular, is systematically moderated by the degree of cyclicality of the industry in which the firm operates. In relatively stable industries, advertising effects are small or even nonsignificant, and they do not go beyond the year the firm advertises. However, in highly cyclical industries, advertising effects are long-lasting, its total effect being 50% larger (market share) and 200% larger (profits) than in industries of average cyclicality. The effect of industry cyclicality on advertising effectiveness is especially pronounced in contractions. Collectively, these findings provide valuable and actionable insights into how firms should respond to contractions in order to grow profits and market share."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2013.0504," We study the role of different contract types in coordinating the joint product improvement effort of a client and a customer support center. The customer support center's costly efforts at joint product improvement include transcribing and analyzing customer feedback, analyzing market trends, and investing in product design. Yet this cooperative role must be adequately incentivized by the client, since it could lead to fewer service requests and hence lower revenues for the customer support center. We model this problem as a sequential game with double-sided moral hazard in a principal-agent framework (in which the client is the principal). We follow the contracting literature in modeling the effort of the customer support center, which is the first mover, as either unobservable or observable; in either case, the efforts are unverifiable and so cannot be contracted on directly. We show that it is optimal for the client to offer the customer support center a linear gain-share contract when efforts are unobservable, even though it can yield only the second-best solution for the client. We also show that the cost-plus contracts widely used in practice do not obtain the optimal solution. However, we demonstrate that if efforts are observable then a gain-share and cost-plus options- based contract is optimal and will also yield the first-best solution. Our research provides a systematic theoretical framework that accounts for the prevalence of gain-share contracts in the IT industry's joint improvement efforts, and it provides guiding principles for understanding the increased role for customer support centers in product improvement."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2021.4103," Every year, nearly 5,000 patients die while waiting for kidney transplants, and yet an estimated 3,500 procured kidneys are discarded. Such a polarized coexistence of dire scarcity and massive wastefulness has been mainly driven by insufficient pooling of cadaveric kidneys across geographic regions. Although numerous policy initiatives are aimed at broadening organ pooling, they rarely account for a key friction—efficient airline transportation, ideally direct flights, is necessary for long-distance sharing, because of the time-sensitive nature of kidney transplantation. Conceivably, transplant centers may be reluctant to accept kidney offers from far-off locations without direct flights. In this paper, we estimate the effect of the introduction of new airline routes on broader kidney sharing. By merging the U.S. airline transportation and kidney transplantation data sets, we create a unique sample tracking (1) the evolution of airline routes connecting all the U.S. airports and (2) kidney transplants between donors and recipients connected by these airports. We estimate the introduction of a new airline route increases the number of shared kidneys by 7.3%. We also find a net increase in the total number of kidney transplants and a decrease in the organ discard rate with the introduction of new routes. Notably, the posttransplant survival rate remains largely unchanged, although average travel distance increases after the introduction of new airline routes.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2844," A growing body of correlational studies suggests that sex hormones such as those contained in, or affected by, oral contraceptives (OCs) may impact economic behavior. However, despite widespread use of OCs among women in Western countries, little is known about their potential behavioral effects. The present study investigates whether OCs causally influence economic preferences. We randomly allocate 340 women aged 18–35 to three months of a widely used OC or placebo treatment. At the end of treatment, we conduct an economic experiment measuring altruism, financial risk taking, and willingness to compete. The statistical power is 80% to detect an effect size equal to a Cohen’s d of 0.30 at the 5% level. We find no significant effects of OCs on any of the measured preferences, indicating that this widely used OC treatment, commonly used throughout the world, does not significantly affect the measured economic preferences. Further, we find no relation between menstrual cycle phase and economic preferences in the placebo group. Data are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2844 .

/doi/10.1287/opre.2021.2112," We study the relationship between capacity and performance for a service firm with spatial operations, in the sense that requests arrive with origin-destination pairs. An example of such a system is a ride-hailing platform in which each customer arrives in the system with the need to travel from an origin to a destination. We propose a parsimonious representation of a spatial multiserver system through a state-dependent queueing model that captures spatial frictions as well as spatial economies of scale through the service rate. In a classical M / M / n queueing model, the square root safety (SRS) staffing rule is known to balance server utilization and customer wait times. By contrast, we find that the SRS rule does not lead to such a balance in spatial systems. In a spatial environment, pick-up times increase the load in the system; furthermore, they are an endogenous source of extra workload that leads the system to only operate efficiently if there is sufficient imbalance between supply and demand. In heavy traffic, we derive the mapping from load to operating regimes and establish implications on various metrics of interest. In particular, to obtain a balance of utilization and wait times, the service firm should use a higher safety factor, proportional to the offered load to the power of 2 / 3 . We also discuss implications of these results for general systems."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2019.0835," Problem definition : We study how a new development in entrepreneurship—crowdfunding—interacts with more traditional financing sources such as venture capital investors (VCs) and bank financing. Academic/practical relevance : Although extant literature has mainly focused on predicting crowdfunding campaign outcomes and optimal campaign design, the broader questions of how crowdfunding affects entrepreneurs and how crowdfunding platforms fit in with traditional startup financing sources, such as banks and VCs, have received relatively little attention. Methodology : We model a bargaining game with a moral-hazard problem between an entrepreneur and a bank, and a double-sided moral-hazard problem between the entrepreneur and a VC with respect to their noncontractible efforts. Results : We decompose the economic value of crowdfunding into cash gains or losses, costs of bad investments avoided, and project-payoff probability update. This economic value is generally shared between entrepreneurs and investors, benefiting both. Moreover, crowdfunding can help to overcome the agency problems. However, crowdfunding can also harm the entrepreneur and the VC. Competition from other investors reduces value to VCs, who may walk away from the deal entirely. This can hurt entrepreneurs who lose out on valuable VC operational expertise (operational support, access to supplier networks, etc.). Managerial implications : The model provides a theoretical underpinning for recent empirical observations that some projects lose VC financing after successful crowdfunding campaigns. Our results complement earlier studies in operations management by demonstrating that the entrepreneurs’ objectives are more complex than simply maximizing the payoffs from crowdfunding campaigns."
/doi/10.1287/inte.2021.1091," Drivers on the Lyft ride-share platform do not always know where the areas of supply shortage are in real time. This lack of information hurts both riders trying to find a ride and drivers trying to determine how to maximize their earnings opportunities. Lyft’s Personal Power Zone (PPZ) product helps the company to maintain high levels of service on the platform by influencing the spatial distribution of drivers in real time via monetary incentives that encourage them to reposition their vehicles. The underlying system that powers the product has two main components: (1) a novel “escrow mechanism” that tracks available incentive budgets tied to locations within a city in real time, and (2) an algorithm that solves the stochastic driver-positioning problem to maximize short-run revenue from riders’ fares. The optimization problem is a multiagent dynamic program that is too complicated to solve optimally for our large-scale application. Our approach is to decompose it into two subproblems. The first determines the set of drivers to incentivize and where to incentivize them to position themselves. The second determines how to fund each incentive using the escrow budget. By formulating it as two convex programs, we are able to use commercial solvers that find the optimal solution in a matter of seconds. Rolled out to all 320 cities in which Lyft operates in a little more than a year, the system now generates millions of bonuses that incentivize hundreds of thousands of active drivers to optimally position themselves in anticipation of ride requests every week. Together, the PPZ product and its underlying algorithms represent a paradigm shift in how Lyft drivers drive and generate earnings on the platform. Its direct business impact has been a 0.5% increase in incremental bookings, amounting to tens of millions of dollars per year. In addition, the product has brought about significant improvements to the driver and rider experience on the platform. These include statistically significant reductions in pick-up times and ride cancellations. Finally, internal surveys reveal that the vast majority of drivers prefer PPZs over the legacy system."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0455," We propose a method for determining how much to charge users of a communication network when they share bandwidth. Our approach can be employed either when a network owner wishes to sell bandwidth for a specified period of time to a number of different users, or when users cooperate to build a network to be shared among themselves. Our proposed contract and balancing mechanism can mediate between rapidly fluctuating prices and the longer time scales over which bandwidth contracts may be traded. An advantage of the process is that it avoids perverse incentives for a capacity provider to increase congestion."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2020.0955," Problem definition : Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are predicted to enter the consumer market in less than a decade. There is currently no consensus on whether their presence will have a positive impact on users and society. The skeptics of automation foresee increased congestion, whereas the advocates envision smoother traffic with shorter travel times. We study the automation controversy and advise policymakers on how and when to promote AVs. Academic/practical relevance : The AV technology is advancing rapidly and there is a need to study its impact on social welfare and the likelihood of its adoption by the public. Methodology : We use supply-demand theory to find the equilibrium number of trips for autonomous and regular households. We develop a simulation model of peer-to-peer AV sharing. We compare the socially optimal level of automation with the selfish adoption patterns where households independently choose their vehicle type. Results : We establish that the optimal social welfare is influenced by: (i) the network connectivity, that is, the ability of the infrastructure to serve AVs, (ii) the additional comfort provided by AVs that allows passengers to engage in other productive activities instead of driving, and (iii) the AV sharing patterns that reduce ownership costs, but create empty vehicle trips that increase congestion. Managerial implications : We investigate the impact of AVs in a case study of Toronto and show that partial automation maximizes social welfare. We show that the comfort of AVs may add traffic that compromises social welfare. Moreover, although traffic increases with automation, travel times may decrease because of significant improvements in traffic flow caused by AV connectivity in the network."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3407," The cities of Paris, London, Chicago, and New York (among many others) have set up bike-share systems to facilitate the use of bicycles for urban commuting. This paper estimates the impact of two facets of system performance on bike-share ridership: accessibility (how far the user must walk to reach stations) and bike-availability (the likelihood of finding a bicycle). We obtain these estimates from a structural demand model for ridership estimated using data from the Vélib’ system in Paris. We find that every additional meter of walking to a station decreases a user’s likelihood of using a bike from that station by 0.194% (±0.0693%), and an even more significant reduction at higher distances (>300 m). These estimates imply that almost 80% of bike-share usage comes from areas within 300 m of stations, highlighting the need for dense station networks. We find that a 10% increase in bike-availability would increase ridership by 12.211% (±1.097%), three-fourths of which comes from fewer abandonments and the rest of which comes from increased user interest. We illustrate the use of our estimates in comparing the effect of adding stations or increasing bike-availabilities in different parts of the city, at different times, and in evaluating other proposed improvements.

/doi/10.1287/msom.2017.0663," We develop a game-theoretic model to explore why retail clusters are so popular in developing economies and when governments should facilitate the formation of retail clusters to improve social welfare. First, we find two determinants of retailer clusters: the valuation-cost ratio (consumers’ maximum valuation over retailers’ production cost) and retailer density (the number of retailers over unit transportation cost). The valuation-cost ratio and retailer density indicate retailers’ profit potential and competition intensity, respectively. Second, the equilibrium cluster size increases in the valuation-cost ratio. This finding explains the phenomenon that clusters are usually larger in developing economies (where numerous retailers sell unrecognized brands with low profit potential) than in developed economies. Third, when the retailer density of a product market exceeds a certain threshold, the market coverages of clusters overlap with each other (i.e., the overlapping case). Furthermore, when compared with the nonoverlapping case, the equilibrium cluster size in the overlapping case is larger for low-profit-potential products but smaller for high-profit-potential products. Together, valuation-cost ratio and retailer density define four types of clusters: overlapping massive clusters, nonoverlapping large clusters, nonoverlapping small clusters, and overlapping mini-clusters. Finally, the socially optimal cluster size is larger than the equilibrium cluster size, and the gap between these two cluster sizes decreases in the valuation-cost ratio.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3350," We investigate the relation between corporate performance and overall economic growth in the United States. In particular, we focus on the impact of the U.S. corporate tax regime on this relation. Exploiting time-series variation and a tax shock, we document that the relatively higher corporate income tax rate and the tax treatment of foreign earnings of U.S. corporations have contributed to a disconnect between the performance of the corporate sector and the overall economy. Specifically, the growth of domestic (national) corporate profits, on average, has outpaced the growth of the domestic (national) economy, and this disconnect increases as the difference between the U.S. corporate income tax rate and the average tax rate of the other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries increases. The underlying mechanism is fewer corporate profits being channeled into subsequent domestic investments when the U.S. tax rate is relatively higher, leading to lower economic growth. Our findings have implications for policy setters. This paper was accepted by Brian Bushee, accounting."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2017.0618," Recent platforms, like Uber and Lyft, offer service to consumers via “self-scheduling” providers who decide for themselves how often to work. These platforms may charge consumers prices and pay providers wages that both adjust based on prevailing demand conditions. For example, Uber uses a “surge pricing” policy, which pays providers a fixed commission of its dynamic price. With a stylized model that yields analytical and numerical results, we study several pricing schemes that could be implemented on a service platform, including surge pricing. We find that the optimal contract substantially increases the platform’s profit relative to contracts that have a fixed price or fixed wage (or both), and although surge pricing is not optimal, it generally achieves nearly the optimal profit. Despite its merits for the platform, surge pricing has been criticized because of concerns for the welfare of providers and consumers. In our model, as labor becomes more expensive, providers and consumers are better off with surge pricing because providers are better utilized and consumers benefit both from lower prices during normal demand and expanded access to service during peak demand. We conclude, in contrast to popular criticism, that all stakeholders can benefit from the use of surge pricing on a platform with self-scheduling capacity.

/doi/10.1287/stsy.2018.0018," We study a model of competition among nomadic agents for time-varying and location-specific resources arising in crowdsourced transportation services, online communities, and traditional location-based economic activity. This model comprises a group of agents and a single location endowed with a dynamic stochastic resource process. Periodically, each agent derives a reward determined by the location’s resource level and the number of other agents there and has to decide whether to stay at the location or move. On moving, the agent arrives at a different location whose dynamics are independent of and identical to the original location. Using the methodology of mean field equilibrium, we study the equilibrium behavior of the agents as a function of the dynamics of the stochastic resource process and the nature of the competition among colocated agents. We show that an equilibrium exists in which each agent decides whether to switch locations based only on the agent’s current location’s resource level and the number of other agents there. We additionally show that when an agent’s payoff is decreasing in the number of other agents at the agent’s location, equilibrium strategies obey a simple threshold structure. We show how to exploit this structure to compute equilibria numerically and use these numerical techniques to study how system structure affects the agents’ collective ability to explore their domain to find and effectively utilize resource-rich areas."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.1030.0045," China and Russia represent major economies in transition from command economies, yet their paths to the market have differed greatly. Their divergent approaches have helped create distinct institutional environments. This study focuses on a particularly important strategic decision firms face—alliance partner selection. The study's results suggest that China's more stable and supportive institutional environment has helped Chinese firms take a longer-term view of alliance partner selection, focusing more on the potential partner's intangible assets along with technological and managerial capabilities. In contrast, the less stable Russian institutional environment has influenced Russian managers to focus more on the short term, selecting partners that provide access to financial capital and complementary capabilities so as to enhance their firms—ability to weather that nation's turbulent environment. This study contributes to knowledge about the influence of the institutional environment on alliance partner selection decisions for firms domiciled in transition (and emerging) economies."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2017.1028," This paper examines firms’ product policies when they sell an add-on (e.g., Internet service) in addition to a base product (e.g., hotel rooms) under vertical differentiation (e.g., four- versus three-star hotels). I show that the role of an add-on differs; higher-quality firms prefer to sell it as optional to discriminate consumers, and lower-quality firms trade off discrimination and differentiation, trying to lure consumers from higher-quality rivals with a lower-price add-on. Equilibrium policies of lower-quality firms are more sensitive to the cost-to-value ratio of an add-on. If the ratio is sufficiently small, then they sell it to all consumers, potentially explaining why lower-end hotels are more likely than higher-end ones to offer free Internet service. Contrary to consensus in the literature, optional add-ons can intensify price competition over consumers who trade off a higher-quality base product versus a lower-quality base including an add-on. Hence, higher-quality firms are incentivized to commit to bundling, while lower-quality firms prefer to commit to not selling it. Add-ons can further reduce lower-quality firms’ profits if consumers cannot observe the prices, because holding up consumers ex post encourages them to switch to higher-quality rivals, which then become better off. Therefore, lower-quality firms are incentivized to advertise add-on prices, and higher-quality firms are not. The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2017.1028 ."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.47.5.629.10486," Forecast sharing is studied in a supply chain with a manufacturer that faces stochastic demand for a single product and a supplier that is the sole source for a critical component. The following sequence of events occurs: the manufacturer provides her initial forecast to the supplier along with a contract, the supplier constructs capacity (if he accepts the contract), the manufacturer receives an updated forecast and submits a final order. Two contract compliance regimes are considered. If the supplier accepts the contract under forced compliance then he has little flexibility with respect to his capacity choice; under voluntary compliance, however, he maintains substantial flexibility. Optimal supply chain performance requires the manufacturer to share her initial forecast truthfully, but she has an incentive to inflate her forecast to induce the supplier to build more capacity. The supplier is aware of this bias, and so may not trust the manufacturer's forecast, harming supply chain performance. We study contracts that allow the supply chain to share demand forecasts credibly under either compliance regime."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1951," Using a proprietary data set, we analyze the impact of the implementation of a “buy-online, pick-up-in-store” (BOPS) project. The implementation of this project is associated with a reduction in online sales and an increase in store sales and traffic. These results can be explained by two simultaneous phenomena: (1) additional store sales from customers who use the BOPS functionality and buy additional products in the stores (cross-selling effect) and (2) the shift of some customers from the online to the brick-and-mortar channel and the conversion of noncustomers into store customers (channel-shift effect). We explain these channel-shift patterns as an increase in “research online, purchase offline” behavior enabled by BOPS implementation, and we validate this explanation with evidence from the change of cart abandonment and conversion rates of the brick-and-mortar and online channels. We interpret these results in light of recent operations management literature that analyzes the impact of sharing inventory availability information. Our analysis illustrates the limitations of drawing conclusions about complex interventions using single-channel data. This paper was accepted by Alok Gupta, special issue on business analytics ."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.1070.0342," Business groups, the leading economic players in emerging economies, have responded to the market-oriented transition primarily through corporate restructuring. Agency theory predicts that acquisition and divestiture would serve the interests of dominant families and foreign investors in different ways. Further, dominant families, foreign investors from shareholder-based countries, and foreign investors from stakeholder-based countries each operate under distinct institutional logics of appropriate restructuring strategies. We test hypotheses about agency and institutional mechanisms using large business groups in Taiwan between 1986 and 1998 as our empirical example. We find that, consistent with both mechanisms, family-controlled business groups are less likely to divest of unrelated businesses. However, the institutional logics mechanism can better explain the relative lack of unrelated acquisition in family-controlled groups and the difference in divestiture between groups with more shareholder-based foreign investment and those with more stakeholder-based investment. Our study contributes to the neo-institutional perspective of corporate restructuring and strategic management in general by empirically separating the two mechanisms and examining organizational responses to conflicting institutional logics. Our study also adds to the understanding of business group restructuring in emerging economies."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3545," We propose a macroeconomic model in which variation in the level of trust leads to higher innovation, investment, and productivity growth. The key feature in the model is a hold-up friction in the creation of new capital. Innovators generate ideas but are inefficient at implementing them into productive capital on their own. Firms can help innovators implement their ideas efficiently but cannot ex ante commit to compensating them appropriately. Rather, firms are disciplined only by the value of their reputations—the present value of their future partnerships. We model trust as a public signal and construct a correlated equilibrium. When trust is high, firms anticipate fruitful collaborations and thus can credibly commit to not expropriating inventors, leading to the more efficient production of new capital. Our model can be used to qualitatively replicate the empirical relation between measures of trust and investment, innovation, and productivity growth—at both the micro and macro level.

/doi/10.1287/orsc.1060.0186," With globalization and the growth in emerging economies, multinational enterprises (MNEs) now frequently confront challenges associated with corrupt governments. Already, a growing body of research has demonstrated that corruption significantly reduces a country’s aggregate inflows of foreign direct investment through its effects on firm performance. We move the analysis of corruption from aggregate financial flows toward managerial theory and practice by examining how firms adjust their strategy for entering foreign markets in corrupt environments and how different types of corruption affect firms’ choices. Building on institutional theory, we predict that MNEs will respond to pervasive and arbitrary corruption in a host country by selecting particular types of equity and nonequity modes of entry. Using data on 220 telecommunications development projects in 64 emerging economies, we find that firms adapt to the pressures of corruption via short-term contracting and entry into joint ventures. We also find that the arbitrariness surrounding corrupt transactions has a significant impact on firms’ decisions, in addition to the overall level of corruption. In contrast to extant research, we show that MNEs use nonequity-entry modes or partnering as an adaptive strategy to participate in markets despite the presence of corruption."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2020.0901," Problem definition : Difficulties in healthcare delivery in developing economies arise from poor road infrastructure of rural communities, where the bulk of the population resides. Although motorcycles are an effective means for delivering healthcare products, governments in developing economies lack expertise in proper maintenance, resulting in frequent vehicle breakdowns. Riders for Health, a nonprofit social enterprise (SE), has developed specialized capabilities that enable significant enhancements in vehicle maintenance. Riders for Health has engaged with the governments and provided its services using different contracting approaches. However, the effect of such practice on improving vehicle availability—the main social mission of Riders for Health—is not well understood. Academic/practical relevance : This paper presents one of the first rigorous analyses of how SEs achieve their goals through innovations in operations. Our analysis highlights the relationship between a social mission objective and a service contract choice, contrasting it with the choice by a profit-maximizing organization traditionally assumed in the service contracting literature in operations management. Methodology : We construct and analyze a stylized model that combines the elements of reliability theory and contract theory, explicitly accounting for the SE’s social mission in her objective function. Results : We find that the “total solution” approach of providing all aspects of vehicle maintenance, including fleet ownership, is a preferred choice for an SE that prioritizes improving vehicle availability; by contrast, an organization that focuses on profit maximization would find this approach less attractive. Moreover, we show that the total solution approach induces the SE to exert more efforts on failure prevention and repair lead time reduction in equilibrium. Our analysis also suggests that the SE could further improve vehicle availability by the total solution approach if it manages a large fleet that consists of vehicles with high resale values. Managerial implications : Our findings provide theoretical support for Riders for Health’s recent move toward the total solution approach as it expands its service into wider rural areas in many countries. The insights obtained from our analysis offer actionable guidelines to other SEs operating in developing economies."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2017.1127," We conceptualize capital markets in terms of resource access and governance, and argue that more developed capital markets facilitate firm restructuring through more effective provision of capital and governance of transactions. We then develop a contingency model that specifies that the effects of capital market development on restructuring vary by (1) types of restructuring, (2) the nature of the economic environments, and (3) firms’ access to resources. We evaluate a broad range of restructuring actions among independent firms and business group affiliates in Singapore and South Korea before and during the economic shock of 1998–1999. Results support our predictions of the impact of capital market development and of contingencies, and highlight the value of incorporating an external capital markets perspective to complement internally focused theoretical explanations for firm restructuring."
/doi/10.1287/msom.1100.0303," We consider outsourcing in two important service settings: call center and order fulfillment operations. An important factor in both is the inherent economies of scale. Therefore, we advance a unifying model covering both applications and study the associated contracting problem under information asymmetry. At the time of contracting, the outsourcing firm, “the originator,” faces uncertainty regarding the demand volume but has private information about its probability distribution. The true demand is quickly observed once the service commences. The service provider invests in capacity before the start of the operation and offers a menu of contracts to screen different types of the originator. Adopting a mechanism design approach, we prove that a menu of two-part tariffs achieves the full-information solution. Hence, it is optimal among all possible contracts (in both settings) because of economies of scale and contractibility of realized demand."

/doi/10.1287/serv.2021.0279," The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented growth to the e-commerce industry, triggering widespread digital service transformation across various business segments in Vietnam. A pressing concern for both businesses and policymakers is whether the sudden peak in customer interest in e-commerce can be sustained in the future. This research seeks to address this concern by considering whether and how customers’ motivations to participate in e-commerce activities have changed. We collected primary data from a self-administered survey to empirically examine how health and safety concerns influence customers’ online shopping behavior during the pandemic, alongside other known determinants for e-commerce participation, namely technology readiness and connectedness. The results confirm that health and safety concerns have a positive influence on customers’ usage of e-commerce after controlling for technology readiness and connectedness. Furthermore, customers in age groups with higher risks of severe COVID-19 symptoms and mortality are more likely to increase e-commerce usage during the social distancing and isolation period. Our results support the idea that the customer base for e-commerce and digital services have expanded beyond the typical tech-savvy and young customers in their twenties. These are promising signs for postpandemic recovery and even expansion, as firms may leverage the momentum of change in customers’ motivations and start tailoring their public relation campaigns to address a wider age range of potential consumers."
/doi/10.1287/deca.2016.0331," Heath et al. [Heath C, Larrick RP, Wu G (1999) Goals as reference points. Cognitive Psych. 38(1):79–109] propose a prospect theory model for goal behavior. Their analytical model is based on the assumption that goals inherit the main properties of the prospect theory value function, i.e., reference point dependence, loss aversion, and diminishing sensitivity. We investigate whether these main properties transfer to goal behavior in the field. We take user activity data from a gamified question and answer (Q&A) community and analyze how users adjust their contribution behavior in the days surrounding goal achievement, where goals are represented by badges. We find that users gradually increase their performance in the days prior to earning a badge, with performance peaking on the day of the promotion. In subsequent days, user performance gradually diminishes again, with the decline being strongest on the day immediately following the badge achievement. These findings reflect the characteristic S-shape of the prospect theory value function which is convex below the reference point and concave above it. Employing the target-based approach, we can interpret the value function as a cumulative density function of a unimodal probability distribution. Our results suggest that it is more likely that active members of the community focus on the next badge relative to the status already achieved, as their next goal and are less likely to focus on more remote (higher-ranked) badges. Our results thus support the transferability of the main properties of the prospect theory value function to goal behavior in the field and suggest a distinct shape of the value function around goals."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.45.9.1239," Relationships between intermediaries and their customers have become increasingly important in recent years. This paper argues that the need for costly ex ante information acquisition and analysis is a major barrier to the participation of investors and firms in sophisticated markets. Long-term relationships between intermediaries and their customers, in which intermediaries provide implicit insurance to customers, can be an effective substitute for costly ex ante investigation. In this way, intermediaries allow firms and investors to reap the benefits of financial markets. Relationships are easiest to sustain when the ongoing benefits to both parties are high. As a result, competition may lower the benefits that can be obtained from relationships."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2021.4048," We examine how the introduction of monetary incentives by a knowledge-sharing platform affects the nonrewarded knowledge activity on the platform. Our setting is a question-and-answer platform that provides monetary incentives for holding live talks. Using a combination of coarsened exact matching and difference-in-differences estimation techniques, we find that the launch of the paid feature creates a positive spillover effect on the hosts’ free contributions, specifically, 9.4%–40.8% more answers in the short run when compared with nonhosts. The paid feature did not result in any significant change in the quality of answers. We suggest reputation building is one plausible mechanism underlying the spillover. Additional analyses reveal the spillover effect is negative for short-lived hosts in the long run, indicating possible crowding out of free contributions. The positive spillover effect for long-lived hosts lasts longer but is also reduced over time. Our findings suggest that introducing monetary incentives can be a viable business model for knowledge platforms to stimulate user contributions in both the paid and related unpaid activities. Yet platform owners should be cautious about the potential negative spillover after users stop contributing to the paid activity and develop effective strategies to maintain users’ long-term interests in the paid program.

/doi/10.1287/msom.2017.0627," In complex supply chains, the benefits and costs of technological innovations do not always accrue equitably to all parties; thus, their adoption may critically depend on sourcing relationships and incentives. In a setting with uncertain and endogenous process yield, we study the potential of two features—contract design and sourcing channel—to create mutual benefit in decentralized value chains, where suppliers bear the costs of new technologies while benefits accrue primarily to buyers. Our focus is on agricultural value chains, where parties may transact through a channel that blends farmers’ produce (“commodity-based channel”) or that allows a one-on-one interaction between farmer and processor (“direct-sourcing channel”). Our study provides insights to companies seeking to incorporate responsible sourcing strategies while also creating economic value—a concept called “creating shared value.” We identify that the technology’s “cost elasticity” drives whether switching sourcing channel, changing contract structure, or adopting an integrated change is necessary to create shared value. This highlights that value chain innovations need to be properly designed—and sometimes combined—to achieve sustainable implementation. We also find that certain simple contracts with a linear or bonus structure are optimal, while other intuitive contracts could be detrimental. Using a data set of farms in Patagonia, Argentina, we estimate that the proposed mechanism could increase average supply chain profit by 6.9% while realizing positive environmental benefits.

/doi/10.1287/trsc.2017.0803," The trend toward shorter delivery lead times reduces operational efficiency and increases transportation costs for Internet retailers. However, mobile technology creates new opportunities to organize the last mile. In this paper, we study the concept of crowdsourced delivery that aims to use excess capacity on journeys that already take place. We consider a service platform that automatically creates matches between parcel delivery tasks and ad hoc drivers. The platform also operates a fleet of dedicated vehicles to serve the tasks that cannot be served by the ad hoc drivers. The matching of tasks, drivers, and dedicated vehicles in real time gives rise to a new variant of the dynamic pickup and delivery problem. We propose a rolling horizon framework and develop an exact solution approach to solve the matching problem each time new information becomes available. To investigate the potential benefit of crowdsourced delivery, we conduct a wide range of computational experiments. The experiments provide insights into the viability of crowdsourced delivery under various assumptions about the behavior of the ad hoc drivers. The results suggest that the use of ad hoc drivers has the potential to make the last mile more cost-efficient and can provide system-wide vehicle-mile savings up to 37% compared to a traditional delivery system with dedicated vehicles.

/doi/10.1287/opre.2021.2139," This paper is a retrospective look at 68 years of publication output of Operations Research , revealing changes in its publications, its authors, and their impact over time and how these changes might affect researchers and practitioners in the present. A total of 5,440 journal articles from its inception in 1952 to 2019 are used. The analysis initially focuses on the most studied topics and then continues with the top research methods and research problems investigated. The top contributing countries and authors to the most investigated research problems are also studied. The results indicate that mathematical programming is the most common research method, whereas inventory is the most investigated problem. However, investigations related to pricing are growing significantly. The United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom publish the most papers, with the United States and Canada having similar publication profiles per capita. Inventory is the most popular research problem studied by North American, Asian, and Middle Eastern countries, whereas European countries focus on scheduling problems. In order to understand the latest research trend, we visualize the networks of the last 10 years of Operations Research that show dynamic programming as the most used method and pricing as the most studied problem. We further visualize the coauthor networks on both dynamic programming and pricing to identify the most significant clusters of researchers and the topics these research clusters collaborate on. Finally, we provide researchers information about where Operations Research is and where it is likely heading."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2017.0687," The nonresidential solar energy market has grown rapidly in the United States. Companies considering the adoption of solar energy have an important choice: whether to purchase the system (direct ownership, or DO) or opt for an agreement with a service provider that offers third-party ownership (TPO). Although this decision is financially very important, empirical research comparing the two models from an operational perspective has been scarce. These issues are particularly relevant considering that federal and state incentives are commonly used to stimulate adoption. This paper presents an empirical analysis of the role of TPO in the operational performance of nonresidential solar energy installations in California. Using a panel data estimation framework, and accounting for factors that influence TPO adoption, the analysis shows that TPO systems performed, on average, approximately 4% better than DO systems) in terms of their production yield. This performance improvement is consistent with better system design under TPO, but not with better solar panel technology selection by TPO providers."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2021.1500," Going beyond prior research that has focused on dyadic, party-specific trust, this study investigates the importance of generalized trust, which is not specific to a counterparty and originates from a broader context. We analyze how generalized trust at the regional level affects the extent to which a firm relies on external suppliers and the performance effects of doing so. Furthermore, we assess how these relationships are impacted by an economic downturn. We exploit differences in generalized trust across 145 regions in 12 European countries and use data on more than a million small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) before and during the Great Financial Crisis (from 2008 to 2010). Control variables are selected via a double-selection procedure based on machine learning. We find that firms in high generalized trust regions, compared with those in low generalized trust regions, source more externally (but do not reduce external sourcing less in an economic downturn) and benefit more from external sourcing during an economic downturn."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2016.1075," Companies increasingly rely on open collaboration communities to create knowledge and organize work. Open collaboration communities are unique in that every consumer of the content created by the community is also a potential contributor. We show that consumption and contribution in open collaboration communities positively reinforce each other, but that the state of the content regulates that feedback loop. As content becomes more developed, it attracts more consumers, but these consumers are less likely to become future contributors. We exploit the abundant data available in our research setting to investigate the heterogeneity in these factors across different types of open collaboration communities. Our results have implications for both researchers and practitioners by suggesting that the feedback between consumption and contribution in an open collaboration community changes over its life span, that the productive life span of these communities may be finite, and that the type and state of the content the community creates may partly determine that life span."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2013.0510," We define an economic network as a linked set of entities, where links are created by actual realizations of shared economic outcomes between entities. We analyze the predictive information contained in a specific type of economic network, namely, a product network, where the links between products reflect aggregated information on the preferences of large numbers of individuals to co-purchase pairs of products. The product network therefore reflects a simple “smoothed” model of demand for related products. Using a data set containing more than 70 million observations of a nonstatic co-purchase network over a period of two years, we predict network entities' future demand by augmenting data on their historical demand with data on the demand for their immediate neighbors, in addition to network properties, specifically, local clustering and PageRank. To our knowledge, this is the first study of a large-scale dynamic network that shows that a product network contains useful distributed information for demand prediction. The economic implications of algorithmically predicting demand for large numbers of products are significant."
/doi/10.1287/opre.2017.1588," From forecasting competitions to conditional value-at-risk requirements, the use of multiple quantile assessments is growing in practice. To evaluate them, we use a rule from the general class of proper scoring rules for a forecaster’s multiple quantiles of a single uncertain quantity of interest. The general rule is additive in the component scores. Each component contains a function that measures its quantile’s distance from the realization and weights its contribution to the overall score. To determine this function, we propose that the score of a group’s combined quantile should be better than that of a randomly selected forecaster’s quantile only when the forecasters bracket the realization (i.e., their quantiles do not fall on the same side of the realization). If a score satisfies this property, we say it is sensitive to bracketing. We characterize the class of proper scoring rules that is sensitive to bracketing when the decision maker uses a generalized average to combine forecasters’ quantiles. Finally, we show how weights can be set to match the payoffs in many important business contexts."
/doi/10.1287/stsc.2020.0104," Although extant research has studied incumbent resistance to digital platforms, it provides little understanding about when grassroots collective action by other ecosystem stakeholders against the digital platform is likely. In this paper, we identify the scope conditions detailing when local stakeholders can initiate grassroots collective action against the digital platform, a unique context characterized by fast growth, distributed innovation, role flexibility, and direct local connectivity, and propose viable solutions. Our conceptual framework suggests that grassroots collective action against the digital platform is most likely when the digital platform operates with localized scarce assets or localized precarious labor and when actors express their grievances through formalized channels. We combine business model design and stakeholder management perspectives to develop design-based solutions that involve a multisided business model structure, an inclusive stakeholder value proposition, and an ecosystem-centered governance. We call the combination of such design efforts relational business model design . To the incipient theory of digital platforms, we contribute a stakeholder-centered view of platform business models operating within local ecosystems, bridging research on collective action and stakeholder management with strategic management of platforms."
/doi/10.1287/trsc.1030.0061," In this paper, we consider empty freight car distribution in a scheduled railway system. We analyze the cost structure for the repositioning of empty cars, and conclude that the distribution cost shows an economy-of-scale behavior. In addition to the cost proportional to the number of cars sent from origin to destination, there is a cost related to car-handling operations at yards, which depends on the number of car groups that are handled. Thus, if we can find a transportation pattern in which fewer but larger groups of cars are built, the total distribution cost can be decreased. The objective of the paper is to propose an optimization model that explicitly takes this economy-of-scale effect into account. We use a time-dependent network to describe the possible car movements in time and space, and show how this network can be transformed into a network with fixed costs on links representing movements of cars with identical origin and destination terminals. The resulting optimization model is a capacitated network design model, where each capacity constraint limits the flow on several arcs. We describe a tabu heuristic for solving the model, and present computational results."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.1050.0131," We explore the concept of regional industrial identity as an important missing component in our understanding of the development of metropolitan regions and the spatial arrangements of industries. While economists and sociologists have explained the location of industry clusters on the basis of unevenly distributed resources, and historians have provided rich descriptive insight into the developmental dynamics of particular metropolitan regions, little systematic theory has been advanced to explain cross-regional inflows and outflows of resources, especially with respect to patterns in cluster development. This paper examines the concept of regional industrial identity as a social code that (1) arises from the shared understandings of residents and external audiences about the suitability of a region for particular kinds of business activity and (2) influences decisions about where to locate investments. We argue that such understandings are principally informed by configurations of industry clusters that have already formed in a region. Clusters, which are the results of historical investments, are also important signals about the types of business that can thrive in the future. We develop theoretical propositions linking characteristics of regional industry cluster configurations, in particular cluster dominance and cluster interrelatedness, to the strength and focus of regional identity and, as a result, to the types and amounts of resources that will develop within and flow into and out of regions."
/doi/10.1287/opre.2017.1616," Many seasonal products are transported via ocean carriers from origin to destination markets. The shipments arriving earlier in the market may sell at higher prices, but faster shipping services can be costly. In this paper, we study a newsvendor-type shipper who transports and sells seasonal products to an overseas market, where the selling price declines over time. A set of vessels with different schedules and freight rates are available to choose from. Our analysis demonstrates that a portfolio of vessels has two distinct effects on mitigating uncertainties in both demand and vessels’ arrival schedules, while these two portfolio effects have been previously understood as separate issues in the literature. To find the optimal portfolio in our problem, we first show that when vessels arrive in a deterministic sequence, the optimal portfolio can either be derived in closed form (in the single-demand setting), or computed efficiently with a variation of the shortest-path algorithm (in the multi-demand setting). Then, based on these results, we propose an approximation procedure to address the general problem with an uncertain arrival sequence. In each iteration of the procedure, we only need to minimize a cost function approximated by a deterministic arrival schedule, and the portfolio generated can converge to the optimal one under mild conditions. Finally, we present a real-world case study to demonstrate several practical implications of managing a carrier portfolio.

/doi/10.1287/msom.2021.0988," Problem definition : “Slugging,” or casual carpooling, refers to the commuting practice of drivers picking up passengers at designated locations and offering them a free ride in order to qualify for high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. Academic/practical relevance : It is estimated that tens of thousands of daily commuters rely on slugging to go to work in major U.S. cities. As drivers save commute time and passengers ride for free, slugging can be a promising Smart Mobility solution. However, little is known about the welfare, policy, and environmental implications of slugging. Methodology : We develop a stylized model that captures the essence of slugging. We characterize commuters’ equilibrium behavior in the model. Results : We find that slugging indeed makes commuters better off. However, the widely observed free-ride tradition is socially suboptimal. As compared with the social optimum, commuters always underslug in the free-slugging equilibrium when highway travel time is insensitive to slugging activities but may overslug otherwise. The socially optimal outcome can be achieved by allowing pecuniary exchanges between drivers and passengers. Interestingly, passengers may be better off if they pay for a ride than if they do not under free slugging. We also find that although policy initiatives to expand highway capacity or improve public transportation always increase social welfare in the absence of slugging, they may reduce social welfare in areas where free slugging is a major commuting choice. Nevertheless, these unintended consequences would be mitigated by the introduction of pecuniary exchanges. Finally, contrary to conventional wisdom, slugging as a form of carpooling can result in more cars on the road and thus, more carbon emissions. Managerial implications : Our results call upon the slugging community to rethink the free-ride practice. We also caution that slugging benefits commuters possibly to the detriment of the environment."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.13.3.303.2773," Where should the boundaries of knowledge between economic actors be located in order to maximize the efficiency of their interactions? In particular, what circumstances determine whether it makes sense for adjacent stages in the value chain to invest in the development of common understanding, and when does it make sense for them to operate in mutual ignorance? To address these questions, it is necessary to construct a kind of production function which takes different forms of knowledge— specialist capability and trans-specialist understanding —as inputs and relates them to problem-solving output. Using a simple model of product design as a template, it is possible to derive such a production function. One can then use its properties in conjunction with plausible assumptions about the cost of acquiring different kinds of knowledge to develop general principles that explain when efficiency requires costly learning across specialties and when it is better to allow specialties to operate in mutual ignorance of one another's domains. The derived production function, contrary to some intuition and previous literature, implies that specialist capability can substitute for knowledge shared across specialties. This result in turn implies that the nature of learning costs, rather than the shape of knowledge benefits, plays the predominant role in determining when mutual ignorance is a good idea. The analysis also helps resolve the following paradox: The economy depends for its efficiency upon a drastic separation of knowledge across individuals and organizational units, yet studies of product development find that greater knowledge commonality is associated with better firm performance. An implication of the substitutability of specialized and trans-specialty knowledge is that situations where learning across specialties is desirable seem relatively rare in the economy as a whole. These situations are disproportionately common, however, in those areas where important managerial activity takes place. A key role of management is to attend to the strategic, operational, and governance needs of these “islands of shared knowledge in a sea of mutual ignorance.”"
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2021.4086," Many applied economic settings involve trade-offs between in-group members and strangers. To better understand decision making in these contexts, this paper measures and investigates the economic relevance of heterogeneity in moral universalism: the extent to which people exhibit the same level of altruism and trust toward strangers as toward in-group members. We first introduce a new experimentally validated, survey-based measure of moral universalism that is simple and easily scalable. We then deploy this tool in a large, representative sample of the U.S. population to study heterogeneity and economic relevance. We find that universalism is a relatively stable trait at the individual level. In exploratory analyses, heterogeneity in universalism is significantly related to observables: Older people, men, the rich, the rural, and the religious exhibit less universalist preferences and beliefs. Linking variation in universalism to self-reports of economic and social behaviors, we document the following correlations. Universalists donate less money locally, but more globally, and are less likely to exhibit home bias in equity and educational investments. In terms of social networks, universalists have fewer friends, spend less time with them, and feel more lonely. These results provide a blueprint for measuring moral universalism in applied settings and suggest that variation in universalism is relevant for understanding a myriad of economic behaviors.

/doi/10.1287/msom.2017.0645," The decisions of whether and how to adopt service differentiation are at the core of a firm’s service operations strategy. This paper proposes a framework for service differentiation that highlights the identification and use of operating segments as a central component in the delivery of differentiated services. The notion of operating segments and the general empirical methodology to identify them proposed in this paper integrally considers the consumer’s preferences and operational capabilities required to fulfill the differentiated service offering. An application in the context of after-sales services for product-service bundles using data from a major manufacturer in the consumer electronics industry is presented, which illustrates how operational decisions need to be adjusted when multiple operating segments are defined to support a service differentiation strategy.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.48.8.955.170," Marketers often stress the importance of treating customers as partners. A fundamental premise of this perspective is that all parties can be weakly better off if they work together to increase joint surplus and reach Pareto-efficient agreements. For marketing managers, this implies organizing marketing activities in a manner that maximizes total surplus. This logic is theoretically sound when agreements between partners are limitless and costless. In most consumer marketing contexts (business-to-consumer), this is typically not true. The question I ask is should one still expect firms to partner with consumers and reach Pareto-efficient agreements? In this paper, I use the example of a firm's choice of product configuration to demonstrate two effects. First, I show that a firm may configure a product in a manner that reduces total surplus but increases firm profits. Second, one might conjecture that increased competition would eliminate this effect, but I show that in a duopoly firm profits may be increasing in the cost of product completion. This second result suggests that firms may prefer to remain inefficient and/or stifie innovations. Both results violate a fundamental premise of partnering—that firms and consumers should work together to increase total surplus and reach Pareto-efficient agreements. The model illustrates that Pareto-efficient agreements are less likely to occur if negotiation with individual partners is infeasible or costly, such as in business-to–consumer contexts. Consumer marketers in one-to- many marketing environments should be wary of treating customers as partners because Pareto–efficient agreements may not be optimal for their firm."
/doi/10.1287/serv.2021.0280," This paper examines older adult care services during the outbreak of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Specifically, it investigates emerging developments initiated or augmented by the pandemic and discusses their permanency in a postpandemic world. Primary survey data are collected from both older adult care-providing organizations (supply) and individuals receiving or considering care (demand) in the United States. Qualitative support from various sources supplements the surveys. The results indicate a movement toward deinstitutional care options, which began prepandemic but intensified during the outbreak. Care organizations confirm this development, reporting more occupancy-related concerns. Findings also suggest that telehealth and digital communication tools have substantially expanded. Benefits, issues, and future projections of these trends are discussed, and some suggestions for industry reform are proposed. These results illuminate many actionable ideas for various stakeholders, including older adults, industry practitioners, and policymakers."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2018.1247," Although researchers have devoted considerable attention to assessing how organizations benefit from ascriptions of high status, relatively little research has analyzed the financial costs that organizations may incur in actively managing such ascriptions. In this study, we analyze how and why organizations may pay a relatively steep economic price for the attainment and/or maintenance of social status. Specifically, we advance an original theoretical perspective, which suggests that firms engaged in economic competition are simultaneously engaged in social ceremony and that these dual processes can generate a combination of social gains (in terms of status) and economic losses (in terms of profitability). We theorize and test our perspective in the context of competitive bidding ceremonies using a unique, decade-long data set on repeated competitive market interactions among firms in the U.S. construction industry. We find support for our prediction that firms’ participation in bidding ceremonies can generate divergent outcomes, that is, higher social status and diminished economic performance. We discuss the implications of our theoretical and empirical analysis for the existing literature on social status, competitive bidding, and—more generally—on the role social forces play in competitive market behaviors and outcomes."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2021.4134," We consider an online assortment optimization problem where we have n substitutable products with fixed reusable capacities c 1 , … , c n . In each period t , a user with some preferences (potentially adversarially chosen) who offers a subset of products, S t , from the set of available products arrives at the seller’s platform. The user selects product j ∈ S t with probability given by the preference model and uses it for a random number of periods, t ˜ j , that is distributed i.i.d. according to some distribution that depends only on j generating a revenue r j ( t ˜ j ) for the seller. The goal of the seller is to find a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative revenue over a finite horizon T . Our main contribution is to show that a simple myopic policy (where we offer the myopically optimal assortment from the available products to each user) provides a good approximation for the problem. In particular, we show that the myopic policy is 1/2-competitive, that is, the expected cumulative revenue of the myopic policy is at least half the expected revenue of the optimal policy with full information about the sequence of user preference models and the distribution of random usage times of all the products. In contrast, the myopic policy does not require any information about future arrivals or the distribution of random usage times. The analysis is based on a coupling argument that allows us to bound the expected revenue of the optimal algorithm in terms of the expected revenue of the myopic policy. We also consider the setting where usage time distributions can depend on the type of each user and show that in this more general case there is no online algorithm with a nontrivial competitive ratio guarantee. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to compare the robustness and performance of myopic policy with other natural policies.

/doi/10.1287/opre.2017.1702," We consider a service system in which customers are loss averse toward both price and delay attributes. That is, customers compare these two attributes with their rational expectations of outcomes, with losses being more painful than equal-sized gains are pleasant. We first study customers’ equilibrium queueing strategies. We find that, unlike the traditional case in which loss aversion is not considered, there may exist three equilibrium strategies, one of which is preferred in the sense that customers’ utility is highest at this equilibrium. We then investigate the optimal pricing problem for a monopoly server and find that loss aversion polarizes queues, making long queues even longer and short queues even shorter. Furthermore, loss aversion toward the delay attribute drives the optimal price down, whereas loss aversion toward the price attribute drives it up. We also find that profit- and welfare-maximizing prices are not the same in a monopoly market. Finally, we consider pricing competition in a symmetric duopoly market and find that the conclusions depend on the size of the service capacity relative to the market size. For fast servers, there exists a unique symmetric price equilibrium. Under certain conditions, the effect of loss aversion on waiting time drives the price down, whereas that on the monetary term drives it up. For moderate-speed servers, there also exists a unique symmetric equilibrium. However, the effect of loss aversion on the two attributes works in reverse compared with that in the fast server case. For slow servers, we show that a symmetric equilibrium may not exist, and we numerically find that there may exist two asymmetric equilibria. Interestingly, with loss-averse customers, a firm can obtain a higher profit in a duopoly market than in a monopoly market.

/doi/10.1287/isre.1040.0029," We use an economic model to formalize the complex relationships among IT investments, intermediate performance measures (e.g., product quality and output levels), and economic performance (e.g., productivity, profits, and consumer surplus). We demonstrate that a profit-maximizing monopolist invests in IT (modeled as changes in parametric characteristics of the firm) to design a better-quality product and charge a higher price. While this profit-maximizing adjustment generates more consumer surplus, it also increases production costs in a way that adversely affects productivity. In contrast, a simple model extension shows that when a firm is unwilling or unable to improve product quality, then IT investments result in suboptimal improvements in profits, an increase in consumer surplus, and an increase in productivity. Together, these models highlight the way in which product quality moderates the relationship between IT investments and economic performance. We also demonstrate that these relationships are robust to the socially optimal case in which a social planner chooses price and quality to maximize social welfare. In addition, we demonstrate that the results of the monopoly model hold when considering the design and development of products offered free of charge (e.g., free online content), but that provide indirect benefits to the firm (e.g., more advertising revenues)."
/doi/10.1287/opre.2016.1533," One of the fundamental concerns in the analysis of logistical systems is the trade-off between localized, independent provision of goods and services versus provision along a centralized infrastructure such as a backbone network. One phenomenon in which this trade-off has recently been made manifest is the transition of businesses from traditional brick-and-mortar stores to retail sales facilitated via e-commerce, such as grocery delivery services. Conventional wisdom would dictate that such services ought to be more efficient—say from the perspective of the overall carbon footprint—because of the economy of scale achieved by aggregating demand through a delivery van, as opposed to the many separate trips that customers would otherwise take using their own means of transport. In this paper, we quantify the changes in overall efficiency due to such services by looking at “household-level” economies of scale in transportation: a person might perform many errands in a day (such as going to the bank, grocery store, and post office), and that person has many choices of locations at which to perform these tasks (e.g., a typical metropolitan region has many banks, grocery stores, and post offices). Thus, the total driving distance (and therefore the overall carbon footprint) that that person traverses is the solution to a generalized travelling salesman problem (GTSP) in which they select both the best locations to visit and the sequence in which to visit them. We perform a probabilistic analysis of the GTSP under the assumption that all relevant locations are independently and identically distributed uniformly in a region and then determine the amount of adoption of such services that is necessary, under our model, in order for the overall carbon footprint of the region to decrease."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3572," General hospitals across the world are becoming larger (i.e., admitting more patients each year) and more complex (i.e., offering a wider range of services to patients with more diverse care needs). Prior work suggests that an increase in patient volume in a hospital service is associated with reduced costs per patient in that service. However, it is unclear how volume changes in one service affect the costs of the other services in the same hospital. This paper investigates such volume-cost spillover effects between elective and emergency admissions and across specialties, using condition-level panel data comprising all acute hospital trusts in England over a period of 10 years. We provide evidence that increased elective volume at a hospital is associated with an increase in the cost of emergency care (a negative spillover). Furthermore, for emergency admissions, we find evidence that increased emergency activity in one specialty is associated with lower costs of emergency care in other specialties (a positive spillover). By contrast, we find no evidence of spillover effects across specialties for elective admissions. We discuss the implications of these findings for individual hospital growth strategies and for the regional organization of hospital systems.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0169," Using a simulated supply chain experiment based on the well-known “beer game,” we examine how changes in order and delivery cycles, availability of shared point-of-sale (POS) information, and the pattern of customer demand affect supply chain efficiency. We find that speeding up cycle time is beneficial, but the sharing of POS information is not necessarily so. Whether or not the sharing of POS information is beneficial depends on the nature of the demand pattern represented by the POS information. If the demand pattern conveys continual change in ultimate downstream customer demand (as does an S-shaped demand pattern), the POS information can distract the upstream decision maker from what is perhaps more immediately relevant information, orders placed by the proximate downstream agent and the supply line."
/doi/10.1287/trsc.2021.1077," Despite their promise, popularity, and rapid growth, the transit implications of ride-hailing platforms (e.g., Uber, Lyft) are not altogether clear. On the one hand, ride-hailing services can provide pooling (i.e., traffic reductions) advantages by efficiently matching customer demand (i.e., trips) with resources (i.e., cars) or by facilitating car-sharing. On the other hand, ride-hailing may also induce extra travel because of increased convenience and travel mode substitution, which may create crowding (i.e., traffic increases). We seek to reconcile these divergent perspectives here, exploring the heterogeneous determinants of ride-hailing’s effects. Taking advantage of Uber’s staggered entry into various geographic markets in California, we execute a regression-based difference-in-differences analysis to estimate the impact of ride-hailing services on traffic volumes. Using monthly micro data from more than 9,000 vehicle detector station units deployed across California, we show that Uber’s effect (either pooling or crowding) on traffic depends on various contextual factors. We find some evidence of pooling effects on weekdays; however, Uber’s entry leads to significant crowding effects on weekends. Furthermore, the crowding effect is amplified on interior roads and in areas characterized by high population density. Although ride-hailing seems to have a substitution effect on public transportation, we find ride-hailing services may have a complementary effect for carpooling users. Finally, we show that premium ride-hailing services (e.g., Uber Black) almost exclusively lead to a crowding effect. We conduct a battery of robustness tests (e.g., propensity score matching, alternative treatment approaches, placebo tests) to ensure the consistency of our findings."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2018.0707," We consider an on-demand service platform using earning-sensitive independent providers with heterogeneous reservation price (for work participation) to serve its time and price-sensitive customers with heterogeneous valuation of the service. As such, the supply and demand are “endogenously” dependent on the price the platform charges its customers and the wage the platform pays its independent providers. We present an analytical model with endogenous supply (number of participating agents) and endogenous demand (customer request rate) to study this on-demand service platform. To coordinate endogenous demand with endogenous supply, we include the steady-state waiting time performance based on a queueing model in the customer utility function to characterize the optimal price and wage rates that maximize the profit of the platform. We first analyze a base model that uses a fixed payout ratio (i.e., the ratio of wage over price), and then extend our model to allow the platform to adopt a time-based payout ratio. We find that it is optimal for the platform to charge a higher price when demand increases; however, the optimal price is not necessarily monotonic when the provider capacity or the waiting cost increases. Furthermore, the platform should offer a higher payout ratio as demand increases, capacity decreases or customers become more sensitive to waiting time. We also find that the platform should lower its payout ratio as it grows with the number of providers and customer demand increasing at about the same rate. We use a set of actual data from a large on-demand ride-hailing platform to calibrate our model parameters in numerical experiments to illustrate some of our main insights."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2020.3581," We study whether and how a firm can enhance social contagion simply by varying the message shared by customers with their friends. We focus on two key components of information contained in the message—information about the sender’s purchase status prior to referral and information about the existence of referral rewards—and their impacts on the recipient’s purchase decision and further referral behavior. In collaboration with an online daily-deal platform, we design and conduct a large-scale randomized field experiment involving more than 75,000 customers to identify the causal effect of different message designs on creating social contagion. We find that small variations in message content can have a significant impact on both recipients’ purchase and referral behaviors. Specifically, we find that (1) adding only information about the sender’s purchase status increases the likelihood of the recipient’s purchase but has no impact on follow-up referrals, (2) adding only information about referral reward increases the recipient’s follow-up referrals but has no impact on purchase likelihood, and (3) adding information about both the sender’s purchase and the referral rewards increases neither the likelihood of purchase nor follow-up referrals. We build a model to analyze the tradeoff between more adoption and more diffusion and implement the best-performing message design in a production system with millions of shared messages per year (with a projected increase in net profits of more than US$1 million per year). We further exploit the rich heterogeneity in deal, recipient, sender, and social-tie characteristics and examine the mechanisms underlying the effect of message design. The results suggest that both social learning and social utility are at work, and the attenuation in the recipient’s purchase is mainly driven by a decrease in social learning resulting from credibility concerns. The findings of the study provide actionable guidelines to firms for optimal design of messages at the aggregate and more granular levels.

System dynamics is used to model the interdependencies between consumer choice, consumer awareness, evolution of powertrain technologies, and service station availability on the macro level. By integrating the agent-based discrete choice model we refine the model parts of consumer choice and consumer awareness. This allows for considering individual consumer choices. Based on real-world data, we apply the model to the established and saturated German market, where replacement purchases dominate. This way we study the interdependencies between the evolution on the macro level and (1) individual replacement purchases as well as (2) heterogeneous consumer behavior. We show that both effects have a clear influence on the market share evolution of electric vehicles. The results indicate that neglecting individual consumer choices in aggregated system models may lead to systematically wrong estimations of the evolution of the market shares of electric vehicles."
/doi/10.1287/isre.1110.0415," Many enterprises that participate in dynamic markets need to make product pricing and inventory resource utilization decisions in real time. We describe a family of statistical models that addresses these needs by combining characterization of the economic environment with the ability to predict future economic conditions to make tactical (short-term) decisions, such as product pricing, and strategic (long-term) decisions, such as level of finished goods inventories. Our models characterize economic conditions, called economic regimes, in the form of recurrent statistical patterns that have clear qualitative interpretations. We show how these models can be used to predict prices, price trends, and the probability of receiving a customer order at a given price. These “regime” models are developed using statistical analysis of historical data and are used in real time to characterize observed market conditions and predict the evolution of market conditions over multiple time scales. We evaluate our models using a testbed derived from the Trading Agent Competition for Supply Chain Management, a supply chain environment characterized by competitive procurement, sales markets, and dynamic pricing. We show how regime models can be used to inform both short-term pricing decisions and long-term resource allocation decisions. Results show that our method outperforms more traditional short- and long-term predictive modeling approaches."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.1100.0546," The resource-based view (RBV) has historically privileged the firm's internal resources and capabilities, often at the exclusion of its institutional context. In this paper, we introduce a culturally informed RBV that explains how cultural elements in the firm's institutional context shape the economic value associated with a firm's strategy. We posit that a firm's institutional context may create or destroy economic value. If the strategy inadvertently becomes associated with a social issue, it poses a risk for the firm. Firms that recognize the dynamic interplay between their resources and their institutional context in the face of social issues can engage in important cultural work, and thereby preserve their strategy's economic value."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2020.3727," A skill’s value depends on dynamic market conditions. To remain marketable, contractors need to keep reskilling themselves continuously. But choosing new skills to learn is an inherently hard task: Contractors have very little information about current and future market conditions, which often results in poor learning choices. Recommendation frameworks could reduce uncertainty in learning choices. However, conventional approaches would likely be inefficient; they would model previous (often poor) observed contractor learning behaviors to provide future career path recommendations while ignoring current market trends. This work proposes a framework that combines reinforcement learning, Bayesian inference, and gradient boosting to provide recommendations on how contractors should behave when choosing new skills to learn. Compared with standard recommender systems, this framework does not learn from previous (often poor) behaviors to make future recommendations. Instead, it relies on a Markov decision process to operate on a graph of feasible actions and dynamically recommend profitable career paths. The framework uses market information to identify current trends and project future wages. Based on this information, it recommends feasible, relevant actions that a contractor can take to learn new, in-demand skills. Evaluation of the framework on 1.73 million job applications from an online labor market shows that its implementation could increase (1) the marketplace’s revenue by up to 6%, (2) contractors’ wages by 22%, and (3) the diversity of new skill acquisitions by 47%. A comparison with alternative recommender systems highlights the limitations of approaches that make recommendations based on previously observed learning behaviors.

/doi/10.1287/msom.2017.0682," We develop new rules for assigning available service representatives to customers in customer contact centers and other large-scale service systems in order to create effective work breaks for the service representatives from naturally available idleness. These are unplanned breaks occurring randomly over time. We consider both announced breaks as well as unannounced breaks. Our goal is to make the mean and variance of the interval between successive breaks suitably small. Given a target break duration, we propose assigning idle servers based on the elapsed time since their last break. We show that our proposed server-assignment rules are optimal for the many-server heavy-traffic (MSHT) fluid model. Extensive simulation experiments support the proposed server-assignment rules in practical cases and confirm the MSHT approximation formulas when the number of servers is very large.

/doi/10.1287/moor.1060.0233," Variational inequality representations are set up for a general Walrasian model of consumption and production with trading in a market. The variational inequalities are of functional rather than geometric type and therefore are able to accommodate a wider range of utility functions than has been covered satisfactorily in the past. They incorporate Lagrange multipliers for budget constraints, which are shown to lead to an enhanced equilibrium framework with features of collective optimization. Existence of such an enhanced equilibrium is confirmed through a new result about solutions to nonmonotone variational inequalities over bounded domains. Truncation arguments with specific estimates, based on the data in one economic model, are devised to transform the unbounded variational inequality that naturally comes up into a bounded one having the same solutions."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2938," The economic links between firms created by customer and supplier relationships are critical determinants of those firms’ values and actions. We demonstrate that significant trade relationships and indirect economic links incrementally explain which firms are more likely to be involved in acquisitions, which pairs of firms are more likely to merge, and which mergers will have the greatest impact, both on value and in motivating follow-on mergers by rivals. Firms with major trade relationships are significantly less likely to acquire, or be acquired by, firms that do not share in those relationships.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.12.6.B255," The division of labor in assembly is facilitated by the conveyor line. Workers are stationed along the line on which the frame of the product being assembled moves. The total job is broken into elements of work and assigned in approximately equal shares to the workers on the line. Each operator adds his share of work as the product passes him. The measure of the division of labor is the amount of time the product spends at each operator's work station. This period is commonly called the “cycle time.” The problem of the economic extent of the division of labor is to determine the optimum cycle time, or that which yields the lowest unit direct labor cost of assembly."
/doi/10.1287/moor.1060.0243," The motivation for this paper is the Walrasian general equilibrium model of economy, as formulated by Arrow and Debreu [Arrow, K., G. Debreu. 1954. Existence of an equilibrium for a competitive economy. Econometrica 22 264–290]. The problem considered takes the form of a system of variational inequalities on a reflexive Banach space as the infinite dimensional commodity space. The conditions sufficient for the existence of solutions are provided by means of the theory of pseudomonotone multivalued mapping due to Browder and Hess [Browder, F. E., P. Hess. 1972. Nonlinear mappings of monotone type in Banach spaces. J. Funct. Anal. 11 251–294], and the Fenchel duality theory combined with the Galerkin method. The analysis is carried out without any lattice considerations and the commodity space is not required to have interior points. The substantial difference of the presented approach in comparison with currently applied methods is that the preferences are not bound by any variant of the ω-properness assumption and the consumption sets are not required to have a cone structure. This paper affords new existence results for both the finite and infinite dimensional setting."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2020.0876," Problem definition : Crowdfunding, a relatively new approach for raising capital for early-stage ventures, has grown by leaps and bounds in the past few years. Entrepreneurs launch a campaign on a web platform and solicit contributions from many potential backers. A primary way that entrepreneurs affect fundraising is by leveraging their social networks to drive traffic to their campaign. We address the following question: When should an entrepreneur send out referral links to impel traffic to the campaign web page? Academic/practical relevance : Prior capital accumulation serves as social proof of the project’s “quality,” which can result in herding. However, prior capital accumulation can also lead to crowding out and bystander effects. Entrepreneurs’ social networks strongly affect their chances of success, but they often do not know when to solicit contacts’ involvement. We investigate this question via a combination of empirical and analytical methods, providing guidance for platform owners and entrepreneurs. Methodology : The social proof/herding mechanism leads to a convex-shaped effect of current accumulation on future contributions, the crowding out scenario leads to a concave-shaped effect, and the initial dominance of herding giving way to the later dominance of crowding out leads to a sigmoidal effect (S-shaped curve). We use a Markov decision process model to derive three alternative optimal referral policies, which we fit to proprietary data from a large crowdfunding platform. We explore heterogeneity in relative model fit across different subsamples of our data, demonstrating that our conclusion is stable over a range of scenarios. Results : Using mathematical models, we identify optimal referral strategies under the concave, convex, and S-curve assumptions. Estimating these models on the proprietary data, we show that the S-curve model exhibits the best fit. Based on estimated model parameters, our simulations show that a nonoptimal (e.g., myopic) expenditure of referrals can lead to a substantially smaller accumulation of funds. Managerial implications : The results of this paper help inform both platform owners and entrepreneurs. Platform owners can perform this sort of analysis to provide guidance to entrepreneurs about referral strategy. The entrepreneurs, in turn, learn that in an environment similar to that represented in our data, they will benefit from concentrating their referrals earlier in the fundraising process, while retaining some portion for the final stages of fundraising. The mix of this early versus late referral allocation within the campaign duration may vary depending on the entrepreneurs’ social capital and referral cost."
/doi/10.1287/opre.1100.0908," Allocating resources in grid computing requires local and external schedulers to communicate in order to achieve an efficient management of the resources themselves. To this end, some economic/market-based models have been introduced in the literature, where users, external schedulers, and local schedulers negotiate to optimize their objectives. In this paper, we propose a tender/contract-net model for the grid resource allocation problem, showing the interactions among the involved actors. The performance of the proposed market-based approach is experimentally compared with a round-robin allocation protocol, a system-centric least-cost allocation approach, and also a market-based approach available from the literature."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2015.0926," This paper investigates the economic value of online reviews for consumers and restaurants. We use a data set from Dianping.com , a leading Chinese website providing user-generated reviews, to study how consumers learn, from reading online reviews, the quality and cost of restaurant dining. We propose a learning model with three novel features: (1) different reviews offer different informational value to different types of consumers; (2) consumers learn their own preferences, and not the distribution of preferences among the entire population, for multiple product attributes; and (3) consumers update not only the expectation but also the variance of their preferences. Based on estimation results, we conduct a series of counterfactual experiments and find that the value from Dianping is about 7 CNY for each user, and about 8.6 CNY from each user for the reviewed restaurants in this study. The majority of the value comes from reviews on restaurant quality, and contextual comments are more valuable than numerical ratings in reviews."
/doi/10.1287/opre.2014.1313," We consider the problem of graph discovery in settings where the graph topology is known and the edge weights are hidden. The setting consists of a weighted graph G with n vertices and m edges and with designated source s and destination t . We study two different discovery problems, namely, (i) edge weight discovery, where the goal is to discover all edge weights, and (ii) shortest path discovery, where the goal is to discover a shortest ( s , t )-path. This discovery is done by means of agents that traverse different ( s , t )-paths in multiple rounds and report back the total cost they incurred. Three cost models are considered, differing from each other in their approach to congestion effects. In particular, we consider congestion-free models as well as models with positive and negative congestion effects. We seek bounds on the number of rounds and the number of agents required to complete the edge weights or the shortest path discovery. Several results concerning such bounds for both directed and undirected graphs are established. Among these results, we show that (1) for undirected graphs, all edge weights can be discovered within a single round consisting of m agents, (2) discovering a shortest path in either undirected or directed acyclic graphs requires at least m − n + 1 agents, and (3) the edge weights in a directed acyclic graph can be discovered in m rounds with m + n − 2 agents under congestion-aware cost models. Our study introduces a new setting of graph discovery under uncertainty and provides fundamental understanding of the problem."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2013.0801," Although store brands (SBs) are becoming increasingly important across the world, their success varies dramatically across consumer packaged goods categories and countries. The purpose of this paper is to provide insight into how such differences in SB success originate. Using a unique data set that combines scanner data for a three- to five-year period with consumer survey data ( n = 20,987) for scores of food, household care, and personal care categories from 23 countries around the world, we identify cross-national regularities as to the role of nine manufacturer and retailer factors in explaining SB market share. For each manufacturer and retailer factor, we determine whether it can be part of a global integration strategy, whether it can be included in a local adaptation strategy, or whether it is a candidate for worldwide learning. Our findings have important implications for national brand manufacturers and retailers."
/doi/10.1287/trsc.2021.1088," This paper proposes a two-tier last-mile delivery model that optimally selects mobile depot locations in advance of full information about the availability of crowd-shippers and then transfers packages to crowd-shippers for the final shipment to the customers. Uncertainty in crowd-shipper availability is incorporated by modeling the problem as a two-stage stochastic integer program. Enhanced decomposition solution algorithms including branch-and-cut and cut-and-project frameworks are developed. A risk-averse approach is compared against a risk-neutral approach by assessing conditional-value-at-risk. A detailed computational study based on the City of Toronto is conducted. The deterministic version of the model outperforms a capacitated vehicle routing problem on average by 20%. For the stochastic model, decomposition algorithms usually discover near-optimal solutions within two hours for instances up to a size of 30 mobile depot locations, 40 customers, and 120 crowd-shippers. The cut-and-project approach outperforms the branch-and-cut approach by up to 85% in the risk-averse setting in certain instances. The stochastic model provides solutions that are 3.35%–6.08% better than the deterministic model, and the improvements are magnified with increased uncertainty in crowd-shipper availability. A risk-averse approach leads the operator to send more mobile depots or postpone customer deliveries to reduce the risk of high penalties for nondelivery."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2020.0927," Problem definition : Participants in matching markets face search and screening costs when seeking a match. We study how platform design can reduce the effort required to find a suitable partner. Practical/academic relevance : The success of matching platforms requires designs that minimize search effort and facilitate efficient market clearing. Methodology : We study a game-theoretic model in which “applicants” and “employers” pay costs to search and screen. An important feature of our model is that both sides may waste effort: Some applications are never screened, and employers screen applicants who may have already matched. We prove existence and uniqueness of equilibrium and characterize welfare for participants on both sides of the market. Results : We identify that the market operates in one of two regimes: It is either screening - limited or application - limited . In screening-limited markets, employer welfare is low, and some employers choose not to participate. This occurs when application costs are low and there are enough employers that most applicants match, implying that many screened applicants are unavailable. In application-limited markets, applicants face a “tragedy of the commons” and send many applications that are never read. The resulting inefficiency is worst when there is a shortage of employers. We show that simple interventions—such as limiting the number of applications that an individual can send, making it more costly to apply, or setting an appropriate market-wide wage—can significantly improve the welfare of agents on one or both sides of the market. Managerial implications : Our results suggest that platforms cannot focus exclusively on attracting participants and making it easy to contact potential match partners. A good user experience requires that participants not waste effort considering possibilities that are unlikely to be available. The operational interventions we study alleviate congestion by ensuring that potential match partners are likely to be available."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.11.5.565.15201," Two studies were conducted to further explore the organizational and economic insights provided by the Cyert-March duopoly model (C-M) described in A Behavioral Theory of the Firm (ABTOF, Cyert and March 1963). Study 1 examined the extent to which two firms that differed solely in the decision behavior of a routine would also differ in organizational (quasiresolution of conflict, uncertainty avoidance, problem-driven search, and organizational learning) and economic (profit, price, market share, cost) measures and impacts. Three such manipulations were separately examined, where each manipulation altered the relative propensity of the firm to be more or less reactive to three events: production growth pressure, price adjustment under organizational goal conflict, and initial price adjustment under profit goal failure. Analysis of the behaviors revealed how subtle changes in these key routines could generate complex organizational and economic effects that impact firm success. The dominant result demonstrated that organizations that did not perform well organizationally did not perform well economically. In addition, higher reactivity resulted in higher costs, in part because of quantified organizational constructs (e.g., slack, pressure). Study 2 examined the data from the first study to determine the extent to which the performance of the duopoly was consistent with a set of eight stylized economic facts drawn from the empirical literature on oligopoly. Study 2 demonstrated consistency with five of the eight stylized economic facts and provided partial support for two others. We conclude that behavioral constructs of ABTOF, as articulated in the Cyert-March duopoly model, provide behavior and performance capabilities that bridge the gap between game-theoretic models of duopoly and the computational and informational realities of organizations."
