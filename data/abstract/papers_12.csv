/doi/10.1287/mksc.2017.1038," We use monthly sales of all wines, beer, and spirits sold between 2006 and 2011 by Sweden’s retail monopoly on alcohol to estimate the causal effect of retail distribution on market share by volume at the product level. Products are defined at the level of the stock-keeping unit. Two institutional features are key to identifying the causal effect: First, the monopolist uses four levels of retail distribution; a change in retail distribution is therefore associated with a discrete shift in the number of stores that carry a product in a given month. Second, the retailer is legally bound and monitored by the European Union to ensure that it acts in a non-discriminatory manner with all its suppliers. These features allow us to rule out many possible confounding factors in estimating the effect of distribution on sales volume. We find large and statistically significant effects from changes in retail distribution on market share by volume across all levels of retail distribution. The associated volume elasticity of retail distribution is convex; the wider the retail distribution the greater the marginal volume increase from further widening. In this market, wider distribution means reaching stores with successively smaller assortment. Our results indicate that the smaller assortment in smaller stores, coupled with a low resistance to compromise, is the main reason for the convex pattern. In other words, convexity appears to be generated by products achieving “a larger share of a smaller pie” as retail distribution expands.

/doi/10.1287/isre.1080.0228," This paper investigates the practice-based learning dynamics that emerge among peers who share occupational practices but do not necessarily work with each other or even know each other because of geographical or organizational distance. To do so, it draws on the literatures on situated learning, networks of practice, and information infrastructures, and on insights from a longitudinal case study of the implementation of a Web-based information system used by people working in the field of environmental health. The system was deeply involved in the transformations of local practices as well as relationships between peers. Based on a dialogue between existing literatures and observations from the case study, this research extends the practice-based perspective on learning to the computer-mediated context of a network of practice. To that effect, it proposes a model of what we call trans-situated learning that is supported by the local universality of an information infrastructure whose use becomes embedded with other infrastructures."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2020.0911," Problem definition : Project outsourcing has been a pronounced trend in many industries but is also recognized as a major cause for project delays. We study how companies can coordinate outsourced projects with uncertain completion times through bilateral contract negotiations. Academic/practical relevance : Misaligned subcontractor incentives may result in substantial losses to both project clients and subcontractors. Coordinating subcontractors’ efforts through proper contracts is imperative to the success of project outsourcing. Most previous studies on project contracting have not addressed subcontractors’ bargaining powers or the dynamic bargaining process in negotiations. We fill in this gap by studying bilateral bargaining between the client and subcontractors, which better reflects real-world negotiations. Methodology : We model project contract negotiations as a multiunit bilateral bargaining game. We derive the conditions such that bilateral negotiations can achieve system coordination and characterize the equilibrium negotiation outcomes. We then compare the conditions and equilibria under various model settings to study their impact on project contracting. Results : Our study uncovers how the coordination of project outsourcing is impacted by the contract form, bargaining power structure, precedence network topology, payment timing, external opportunities, and negotiation protocols. For single-task projects, the widely used fixed-price (cost-plus) contract can achieve system coordination only when the subcontractor (client) possesses full bargaining power. Cost-sharing and time-based incentive contracts, which perform well for single-task projects, may not be effective for projects with parallel tasks when any subcontractor’s bargaining power is sufficiently high. Projects with serial tasks can be coordinated only under certain extreme bargaining power structures. Delaying payments always exacerbates the incentive misalignment. Managerial implications : Our analysis provides insights and guidelines to companies regarding how to select proper contract forms and payment timing schemes, based on the characteristics of the projects and subcontractors, to ensure the effectiveness of project outsourcing. Our results also highlight the importance of bargaining modeling in project contracting."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2018.3280," How do emerging market corporates fare during periods of currency depreciation? We find that nonfinancial firms that exploit favorable global financing conditions to issue U.S. dollar bonds and build cash balances are also those whose share price is most vulnerable to local currency depreciation. In particular, firms’ vulnerability to currency depreciation derives less from the foreign currency debt as such, and more from the cash balances that are built up by using foreign currency debt. Overall, our results point to a financial motive for dollar bond issuance by emerging market firms in carry trade–like transactions that leave them vulnerable in an environment of dollar strength.

/doi/10.1287/opre.2015.1448," We study the evolution of opinions (or beliefs) over a social network modeled as a signed graph. The sign attached to an edge in this graph characterizes whether the corresponding individuals or end nodes are friends (positive links) or enemies (negative links). Pairs of nodes are randomly selected to interact over time, and when two nodes interact, each of them updates its opinion based on the opinion of the other node and the sign of the corresponding link. This model generalizes the DeGroot model to account for negative links: when two adversaries interact, their opinions go in opposite directions. We provide conditions for convergence and divergence in expectation, in mean-square, and in almost sure sense and exhibit phase transition phenomena for these notions of convergence depending on the parameters of the opinion update model and on the structure of the underlying graph. We establish a no-survivor theorem, stating that the difference in opinions of any two nodes diverges whenever opinions in the network diverge as a whole. We also prove a live-or-die lemma, indicating that almost surely, the opinions either converge to an agreement or diverge. Finally, we extend our analysis to cases where opinions have hard lower and upper limits. In these cases, we study when and how opinions may become asymptotically clustered to the belief boundaries and highlight the crucial influence of (strong or weak) structural balance of the underlying network on this clustering phenomenon."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1484," Entrepreneurs that were employed by successful industry incumbents prior to founding tend to confer advantages on their new organizations. We propose and then demonstrate a similar “network progeny” effect rooted in the social relationships that form among entrepreneurs. Our analysis of new entrants into the Ontario wine industry shows that prefounding friendship ties of the founders of one especially prominent entrepreneurial firm led to significantly higher ice wine prices. This attests to the promise of a network progeny extension of the parent–progeny account of new firm success. Follow-on analysis indicates that this effect is not attributable to an entrant's ability to make ice wines of superior quality or to it having access to better distribution knowledge. We therefore conclude that having a social tie to this prominent entrepreneurial firm generated reflected prominence that enhanced the valuations and therefore prices of wines made by connected market entrants.

/doi/10.1287/trsc.1120.0450," Congestion pricing, one of the effective tools to reduce congestion in a transportation network, may cause inequity among commuters if the differences in their value of time (VOT) are not properly taken into account. In this paper, we develop a bimodal competition model within the context of nonidentical commuters and departure time choice to study toll design, mode share, and benefit distribution problems. We first show that for a single bottleneck without schedule-late delay, commuters pass the bottleneck in increasing order of VOT under an optimal dynamic toll, and the optimal toll curve is strictly increasing and convex. Equipped with this result, we then derive the corresponding toll patterns, departure profiles, mode share, and user benefits in the morning commute under congestion tolls. We find that a queue-eliminating dynamic toll on the highway can drive the two-mode system to optimum, and it is Pareto improving. However, when a constant toll is used, commuters in the middle of the VOT distribution are possibly made worse off by the toll. By proposing a transit subsidy together with a toll charge on the highway, we obtain a core of feasible toll plus subsidy schemes that can simultaneously achieve three goals: driving the system toward optimum, benefiting every commuter, and financing itself without external investment. The results show that to be in this core, the toll charge can neither be too low nor too high."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2014.0869," Conventional wisdom suggests that when firms face a negative externality like gray marketing (i.e., the selling of branded goods outside of the manufacturer’s authorized channels), an effective strategy to reduce the negative impact is to centralize decision making. Nevertheless, in industries with significant gray marketing, we observe many firms with decentralized decision making. Our study assesses whether decentralized decision making can be optimal when a manufacturer faces gray market distribution. We consider a market where a focal firm competes with an existing competitor that produces a differentiated product and a gray marketer that sources an identical product from a lower-priced foreign market. We find that decentralization is optimal under quantity-based competition, provided the gray market is relatively uncompetitive and the level of competitive intensity between the focal firm and the competitor is high. Decentralization leads a firm to make aggressive production decisions, which leads to lower prices, yet it also leads to higher market share for the firm compared to centralization. When the level of competitive intensity between a firm and its competitor is high, the gain in market share more than offsets the loss due to lower prices. As a result, the focal firm is better off decentralizing its operations independent of (a) whether the competitor operates in the foreign market, and (b) the competitor’s organizational structure. This finding contradicts the belief that centralized decision making is always optimal when authorized manufacturers attempt to limit the negative impact of gray markets. The findings also provide insight to understand why firms might employ decentralized decision making in industries where gray markets are active."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.7.5.502," Firms are organizations that represent social knowledge of coordination and learning. But why should their boundaries demarcate quantitative shifts in the knowledge and capability of their members? Should not knowledge reside also in a network of interacting firms? This line of questioning presents the challenge to state an alternative view to the “theory of the firm,” a theory that has moved from Coase's early treatment of what firms do to a concern with ownership, incentives, and self-interest. We return to Coase's original insight in understanding the cost and benefits of a firm but based on a view that individuals are characterized by an “unsocial sociality.” Does the perception of opportunism generate the need to integrate market transactions into the firm, or do boundaries of the firm lead to the attribution of opportunism? This basic dichotomy between self-interest and the longing to belong is the behavioral underpinning to the superiority of firms over markets in resolving a fundamental dilemma: productivity grows with the division of labor but specialization increases the costs of communication and coordination. The knowledge of the firm has an economic value over market transactions when identity leads to social knowledge that supports coordination and communication. Through identification, procedural rules are learned, and coordination and communication are facilitated across individuals and groups of diverse specialized competence. A firm is distinct from a market because coordination, communication, and learning are situated not only physically in locality, but also mentally in an identity. Since identity implies a moral order as well as rules of exclusion, there are limitations and costs to relying upon a firm for exchange as opposed to the market. These costs are not necessarily those traditionally assigned to the category of decreasing returns to hierarchy. For example, an identity implies that some practices, and businesses, may be notionally inconsistent with each other. Norms of procedural justice that are identified with a firm imply that not all technically feasible complements are permissible within the logic of a shared identity. There is consequently a cost to an identity that offsets the benefits. Because the assemblage of elements that compose an organization are subject to requirements of consistency, identities rule out potentially interesting avenues of innovation and creativity. We illustrate these ideas by returning to the original prisoners’ dilemma game and by an analysis of the coherence of a firm as a search for complements that are consistent with norms of procedural justice. We argue that the underlying dynamic of a prisoners' dilemma game reveals the problems of coordination, communication, and conflicts in norms of justice when players are deprived of social knowledge and shared identity. Similarly, the determination of a firm's coherence arises out of the demand for a moral and notional consistency in the “categorization” of its activities, as opposed to a technological necessity. These ideas are illustrated through an empirical examination of logical complements in high performance work systems."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.8.3.257," The authors examine the meaning of control in international joint ventures (IJVs) and the relationships of potential means of control in such organizations to the performance satisfaction of the foreign partner. They propose a conceptual model that provides both a traditional ownership-focused internalization perspective on those issues and an integrated approach combining a broader transaction cost interpretation of control with a resource input-based bargaining power model. A set of simultaneous structural equations with endogenous explanatory variables provides multiple possible paths from various resource and power inputs through different means of control to perceived performance satisfaction. In such a model, intermediate variables act both as dependent and independent variables; thus the complex theoretical interactions of the variables are modeled more comprehensively and realistically than in single-equation models. To test the model and compare the theoretical relationships, the authors used data from a survey of managers in Norwegian multinational firms having at least one IJV. For structural equation modeling with latent variables, they used the LISREL VII program that simultaneously fits the measured variables to the latent variables and provides a maximum likelihood solution for the structural equation system. The results clearly reject the traditional internalization approach to IJV governance that relies strictly on ownership share to delineate degree of control. However, relative resource input has a strong relationship to relative bargaining of the parent companies, which then drives equity share, control over specific activities, and perceptions of overall control of the IJV. That result supports a bargaining-power-based model of IJV control. The relatedness of the strategic resources of the parent and the joint venture also drives specific control, implying that although transaction risk is important to governance, governance is provided by specific control rather than ownership level. Perceptions of performance are strongly and positively related to overall control. Those results suggest that specialized control provides both protection and exploitation of key resource inputs and is gained through increased bargaining power. Higher levels of specific control result in a perception of overall control and thereby satisfaction with perceived levels of IJV performance among foreign parent company managers. Interestingly, traditional exogenous determinants of IJV control and performance such as government mandates, cultural similarity, and international experience levels fail to provide significant effects. Rather, the focus is on endogenous aspects of the parent-IJV relationship, suggesting that the key to parent firm satisfaction with an IJV is control over operations that use key strategic inputs from the parent."
/doi/10.1287/opre.2016.1507," Dynamic spectrum access is a new paradigm of secondary spectrum utilization and sharing. It allows unlicensed secondary users (SUs) to exploit the opportunistically underutilized licensed spectrum. Market mechanism is a widely used promising means to regulate the consuming behaviours of users and, hence, achieve the efficient allocation and consumption of limited resources. In this paper, we propose and study a hybrid secondary spectrum market consisting of both the futures market and the spot market , in which SUs (buyers) purchase underutilized licensed spectrum from a spectrum regulator (SR), either through predefined contracts via the futures market, or through spot transactions via the spot market. We focus on the optimal spectrum allocation among SUs in an exogenous hybrid market that maximizes the secondary spectrum utilization efficiency. The problem is challenging because of the stochasticity and asymmetry of network information. To solve this problem, we first derive an off-line optimal allocation policy that maximizes the ex ante expected spectrum utilization efficiency based on the stochastic distribution of network information. We then propose an online Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction that determines the real-time allocation and pricing of every spectrum based on the realized network information and the prederived off-line policy. We further show that with the spatial frequency reuse, the proposed VCG auction is NP-hard; hence, it is not suitable for online implementation, especially in a large-scale market. To this end, we propose a heuristics approach based on an online VCG-like mechanism with polynomial-time complexity, and further characterize the corresponding performance loss bound analytically. We finally provide extensive numerical results to evaluate the performance of the proposed solutions."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2776," Theory and recent empirical literature suggest that social and professional connections may influence corporate policy. However, inference may be biased by the possibility that firms who share peers also share unobserved characteristics that are correlated with observed policy. Using a novel identification strategy, we predict and find that director connections through well-known island tax havens have a significant effect on corporate tax policy. Specifically, we find that U.S. firms with directors who are connected to firms domiciled on the islands of the Bahamas, Bermuda, or the Caymans exhibit significantly greater tax avoidance than other U.S. firms. The presence or arrival of an island director is associated with a reduction of between one and three percentage points in the firm’s effective tax rate. We also observe a significant increase in the use of tax haven subsidiaries following the arrival of the island director. This paper was accepted by Mary Barth, accounting."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.1080.0447," We use data on all manufacturer funding and promotion activity by a major U.S. retailer during a two-year period to compute promotion pass-through and assess its magnitude. Then, we estimate a two-tiered probit and lognormal regression model to study drivers of the large variation we observe in pass-through rates. Although our analysis is based on data from a single retailer, it provides a much more complete picture of the magnitude and variability of pass-through than has been available to date. Some key insights from our work are as follows. First, the retailer passes through more than 100% of the total manufacturer funding it receives in aggregate, but the median pass-through rate for individual manufacturers is much lower than 100%. Second, some manufacturers are promoted even without funding. This is more likely for private label and high-share manufacturers in high-lift and high-margin categories. Third, a small number of manufacturer and category characteristics explain a significant amount of the variation in pass-through. In particular, pass-through is higher for private label. It increases with the share of the manufacturer in the focal category but also with the sales of that manufacturer in other categories. Categories with high sales, high promotion lift, low concentration, and low margin get more pass-through. We corroborate some recent conclusions in the literature, e.g., that some pass-through rates are much higher than 100% and that high-share manufacturers get more pass-through. We add several new insights, e.g., on the magnitude of aggregate pass-through, on cross-pass-through across and within categories, on pass-through for private label, and on the category drivers of pass-through."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2019.0846," The omnipresence of smartphones means that more and more personal information is accessed, transferred, or stored on these devices. Smartphone users struggle to control the release of their information when smartphones are always connected, close at hand, and the privacy settings for individual apps are difficult to access. To have meaningful privacy in this context, individuals must be knowledgeable about their devices and truly motivated to make use of the device’s privacy settings. We draw from extant privacy literature, the self-efficacy theory, and the information–motivation–behavioral skills model to understand usage of privacy settings on smartphones through data from 334 iPhone users. Our findings indicate that personal motivation is one of the strongest determinants of utilizing privacy-protective settings, and social motivation is not significant. Furthermore, privacy knowledge and self-efficacy constructs (i.e., knowledge specific to the device’s privacy settings) determine one’s use of privacy-protective settings, but knowledge and self-efficacy about smartphone technology do not. An interaction effect also exists between privacy knowledge and privacy self-efficacy such that people with high levels of privacy knowledge utilize less restrictive privacy settings when their confidence in protecting themselves is low, but as their self-efficacy increases, they are more likely to use more privacy-protective settings. We label this the privacy knowledge–belief gap."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2598," We integrate heterogeneity and uncertainty in investor valuations into a model of takeovers. Investors have dispersed valuations, holding shares in firms they value more highly, and a successful offer must win approval from the median target shareholder. We derive the consequences for an acquiring firm’s takeover offer—its size and cash/equity structure—and implications for takeover premia, firm returns, share price dynamics, the probability that a takeover succeeds, and shareholder welfare. We characterize when the acquirer prefers cash offers and when equity offers are best. Our model collectively reconciles various empirical regularities that have proven elusive to explain in one unified framework, and we derive new testable predictions.

We use unique data from a social trading platform that allow us to observe the shared portfolios of traders, their posted comments, and the replicating transactions of followers. We find robust evidence that followers increasingly replicate shared portfolios of traders after the posting of comments. However, postings do not help followers identify portfolios that deliver superior performance in the future. In a cross-sectional analysis, we show that it is mainly followers typically considered to be unsophisticated who trade after comment postings. This paper was accepted by Tyler Shumway, finance."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.46.10.1317.12271," Motivatedby the exceptionally high mortality statistics of dialysis patients and the ongoing debate about the adequacy of the current reimbursement for dialysis in the United States, we pursue a detailed analysis of the dialysis delivery system. The analysis is based on a multiclass fluid model for the dialysis facility, which combines a pharmacokinetics model of dialysis and an empirically validated model of dialysis-specific mortality. Assuming that the facility operates under budget and capacity constraints, our analysis determines the main factors that affect the delivery of dialysis. Numerical results, which are representative of the dialysis environment in the US, demonstrate the accuracy of the model and provide concrete insights about the operations of the dialysis facility. A major finding is that an improvement in the technology of dialysis is likely to have a more substantial impact on the overall life expectancy of the dialysis population as compared to an increase in the dialysis reimbursement rate."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2020.0934," Scarcity-based marketing strategies have been widely embraced to communicate the potential unavailability of an item to increase sales. Recently, a similar practice has been prevalently implemented in reward-based crowdfunding in the form of reward limits, whereby campaign creators restrict the number of backers for each reward tier. Whereas most current research has focused on the design strategies of crowdfunding campaigns, less attention has been paid to how campaign design implicates backer-as-consumer needs in reward-based crowdfunding. Drawing on the marketing literature regarding product scarcity and consumer psychology, the current study strives to fill this void by uncovering the effect of reward limits on eventual and concurrent funding performance. Specifically, we performed campaign-level and campaign day–level analyses on a unique data set from a dominant crowdfunding platform. At the campaign level, we determined that setting reward limits at the beginning of a campaign is beneficial, with the number of limited reward tiers exerting an inverted-U-shaped relationship with campaign performance. Further exploration of different forms of reward limits suggests that the scarcity effects largely originate from limited edition and price discount rewards. At the campaign day level, we determined that incorporating new limited edition rewards is helpful for attracting new contributions, whereas depleted price discount rewards will demotivate subsequent contributions. In addition, the goal-directed mechanism in crowdfunding plays an influential role in shaping scarcity effects. Our findings highlight the importance of considering backer-as-consumer needs in campaign design and the dynamics of campaign attribute changes in the fundraising process. The goal-directed mechanism in crowdfunding allows us to add further insights to the marketing literature on product scarcity by considering a noneconomic component of the scarcity effect. Our findings also provide important practical implications for platform operators, campaign creators, and marketers."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3385," Innovative firms rely increasingly on academic science, yet they exploit only a small fraction of all academic discoveries. Which discoveries in academia do firms build upon? We posit that hubs play the role of bridges between academic science and corporate technology. Tracking citations from patents to approximately 10 million academic articles, we find that hubs facilitate the flow of academic science into corporate inventions in two ways. First, hub-based discoveries in academia are of higher quality and are more applied. Second, firms—in particular young, innovative, science-oriented ones—pay disproportionate attention to hub-based discoveries. We address concerns regarding unobserved heterogeneity by confirming the role of firms’ attention to hub-based science in a set of 147 simultaneous discoveries. Importantly, hubs not only facilitate localized knowledge flow but also extend the geographic reach of academic science, attracting the attention of distant firms.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2942," This paper analyzes a setting in which a manufacturer (he) and a retailer (she) face uncertain demand, but the retailer has an information advantage in the form of a private demand forecast. Such information asymmetry causes the manufacturer to incur a hidden information cost . The results show that a manufacturer can leverage his timing advantage to strategically implement a temporary contract adjustment (TCA) mechanism, which allows him to counter his informational disadvantage and either eliminate or reduce the hidden information cost. The manufacturer implements the TCA mechanism by designing the supply contract with two sets of terms: presignal and postsignal. Presignal terms engage the retailer before observing the forecast signal and induce her to decide under high uncertainty. As a result, she overinvests when the forecast signal is low. Postsignal terms engage her after the signal, allowing her to make use of the information and purchase additional stock efficiently based on the forecast signal. This ability to utilize the forecast information allows the manufacturer to set more efficient contract terms. By applying the TCA mechanism to a simple wholesale price contract, the manufacturer can achieve the effect of free, partial information revelation as if he observes a coarse version of the retailer’s private forecast. By applying the TCA mechanism to a (stronger) quantity-transfer menu, the manufacturer can achieve the effect of free, full information revelation (i.e., full information profits) as if he fully observes the same version of the forecast, without the retailer directly sharing her private information.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2881," We explore the joint effects of group decision making and group gender composition on the calibration of confidence judgments. Participants in two laboratory experiments, individually and in groups of three, stated confidence interval estimates for general-knowledge questions and for financial forecasts. Across both studies, our results reveal that groups with at least one female member are significantly better calibrated than all-male groups. This effect is mediated by the extent to which group members share opinions and information during the group discussion. Moreover, we find that compared to a statistical aggregation of individual confidence intervals, group discussions have a neutral or positive effect on the quality of confidence judgments for groups with at least one female group member; in contrast, group discussion actually harms confidence calibration for all-male groups. Overall, our findings indicate that compared to all-male groups, even the inclusion of a small proportion of female members can have a strong effect on the quality of group confidence judgment.

/doi/10.1287/mksc.1080.0403," This paper combines different aggregate-level data sets to identify new product demand in consumer packaged goods (CPG) categories. Our approach augments market-level time-series data with widely available summaries of household purchase behavior, i.e., brand penetration and purchase set size data. We show that this augmentation is helpful in the estimation of consumer heterogeneity. For instance, observing a brand with relatively large shares and low penetration typically indicates that preferences are dispersed, with relatively few customers liking the brand a lot. Whereas the combination of share and penetration is informative about heterogeneity with realistic sample sizes, in isolation neither variable may lead to precise estimates of heterogeneity. In addition, other widely available data, e.g., category penetration, is helpful in estimating the size of the total market. Using a large Monte Carlo study, the paper demonstrates the benefits of the proposed approach in estimating model parameters, price elasticities, and brand switching. Empirically, the approach is used to evaluate the launch of a new national brand, DiGiorno, in the frozen pizza category. The new brand is inferred to be very successful at expanding the category, while avoiding cannibalization of existing company share. Using only standard information, i.e., market shares, to estimate the demand model leads, in our data, to poor estimates of the degree of consumer taste variation and of switching to a new brand."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2014.0919," This article uses a longitudinal qualitative analysis of key transitions in the relationship between Fiat Group Automobiles and a major supplier to integrate a pragmatist model of action into the contemporary “practice” approach to the study of organizations. It builds on an affinity between pragmatist and practice approaches that has been widely recognized but has not yet been fully developed with reference to an empirical case. It argues that an analytic reliance on a pragmatist conception of agency improves on the more general reliance in studies of organizational practice on a conception of the agent imported from Giddens’ structuration theory [Giddens A (1984) The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration (Polity Press, Cambridge, UK)]. The argument is developed with reference to a long-standing debate in organization theory—the debate over the determinants of organizational boundaries—that has grown in importance as companies have responded to market and technological volatility by involving suppliers not just in the production but also in the conceptualization and design of the products they sell. It provides a theoretical framework that can help analyze the place of managerial agency in organizational strategy making and explain why organizational boundaries in many industries today are so unsettled and contested and are likely to remain so in the future."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2021.3956," We compare the implications of speculation versus hedging channels for bond markets in heterogeneous agents’ economies. Treasuries command a significant risk premium when optimistic agents speculate by leveraging their positions using bonds. Disagreement drives a wedge between marginal agent versus econometrician beliefs (sentiment). When speculative demands dominate, the interaction between belief heterogeneity and sentiment helps rationalize several puzzling characteristics of Treasury markets. Empirically, we test model predictions and find that larger disagreement (i) lowers the risk-free rate, (ii) raises the slope of the yield curve, and (iii) with positive sentiment increases bond risk premia and makes its dynamics countercyclical.

/doi/10.1287/msom.2017.0634," The presence of strategic customers may force an already financially distressed firm into a death spiral: sensing the firm’s financial difficulty, customers may wait strategically for deep discounts in liquidation sales. In turn, such waiting lowers the firm’s profitability and increases the firm’s bankruptcy risk. Using a two-period model to capture these dynamics, this paper identifies customers' strategic waiting behavior as a source of a firm’s cost of financial distress. We also find that customers' anticipation of bankruptcy can be self-fulfilling: when customers anticipate a high bankruptcy probability, they prefer to delay their purchases, making the firm more likely to go bankrupt than when customers anticipate a low probability of bankruptcy. Such behavior has important operational and financial implications. First, the firm acts more conservatively when facing either more severe financial distress or a large share of strategic customers. As its financial situation deteriorates, the firm lowers inventory alone when financial distress is mild or only a small share of customers are strategic and lowers both inventory and price in the presence of severe financial distress and a large fraction of strategic customers. Under optimal price and inventory decisions, strategic waiting accounts for a large part of the firm’s total cost of financial distress, although a larger proportion of strategic customers may result in a lower probability of bankruptcy. In addition to inventory reduction and (immediate) price discount, we find that a deferred discount, in the form of rebates and/or store credits for future purchases, can act as an effective mechanism to mitigate strategic waiting. As a contingent price reduction, deferred discounts align the interests of customers and the firm and are most effective when the fraction of strategic customers is high and the firm’s financial distress is at a medium level."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2018.1245," We study knowledge flows between organizations through secondments, short-term employee assignments at an organization different from the home institution. Secondments allow the sending organization to capture knowledge and network resources from the receiving organization without an organization-level contract, alliance, or colocation, a process we term learning by seconding . We focus on the National Science Foundation (NSF) rotation program, under which the NSF employs academics, called rotators, on loan from their university, to lead peer reviews. We ask how rotators affect the behavior of their academic colleagues after returning from a secondment. Using difference in differences estimations, we show that rotators’ colleagues raise considerably more research funds than similar scientists who do not have a rotator colleague. Additional quantitative and qualitative evidence implies that the treatment effect occurs via knowledge transfer, as rotators help generate ideas, frame proposals, and explain processes, rather than rent-seeking on the part of the rotator. Overall, the results suggest that strong ties and shared social identity play an important role in organizational knowledge acquisition.

/doi/10.1287/opre.1120.1097," We propose a novel analytic approach for the comparative statics analysis of multiproduct multiresource newsvendor networks under responsive pricing. Our approach involves exploiting the properties of the primal mathematical programming formulation and of the dual variables and linking those properties to the concept of convex orders and to properties of the underlying demand function. The use of convex orders allows us to establish our main results without restriction to a specific demand distribution. A major strength of our approach is that it is “scalable,” i.e., it applies to newsvendor networks with any number of “nonindependent” (i.e., demand or resource sharing) products and resources, without an exponential increase in effort as problem size increases. This is unlike the current approaches commonly used in the operations management literature, which typically involve a parametric analysis of the recourse problem, followed by the use of Jacobians and the implicit function theorem. Providing a rigorous framework for comparative statics analysis, which can be applied to other problems that are not amenable to traditional parametric analysis, is our main contribution. We demonstrate this approach on the optimal capacity decision problem in multiproduct newsvendor networks under responsive pricing, formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming problem with recourse: The firm determines the resource capacities ex ante, in the first stage, when demand intercepts are uncertain, and makes the pricing and production decisions ex post, in the second stage, when demand intercepts (e.g., market conditions) are fully observed. This particular problem and its variants are well studied in the operations management literature. A comparative statics analysis is integral to the study of the capacity investment decision, as it allows answers to important questions such as the following: “Does the firm acquire more or less of the different resources available as demand uncertainty increases? Does the firm benefit from an increase in demand uncertainty?” Using our proposed approach, we establish comparative statics results on how the newsvendor's expected profit and optimal capacity decision change with demand risk in multiproduct multiresource newsvendor networks. We also extend our analysis to the study of demand dependence in two-product networks."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1056," Recent product introductions such as the Xbox 360, Sony Playstation 2, and PT Cruiser have been characterized by shortage of these products. Some experts have suggested that such scarcity can be a deliberate strategy for making the product more desirable. In this paper, we empirically examine the relationship between introductory inventory levels and consumer preference in the U.S. automobile industry and show that relative scarcity of a car at the time of introduction is associated with higher consumer preference for the product. Furthermore, we perform an empirical test of alternative theories about the rationale for introductory product scarcity. Specifically, we consider two theories of supplier-induced scarcity, namely the buying frenzy theory and the signaling theory, and an alternative theory that suggests that demand uncertainty causes introductory product scarcity. We find more support for the signaling theory of supplier-induced scarcity than the buying frenzy theory or the demand uncertainty theory in our analysis of the automobile market."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2020.3753," We examine whether and how payout policy affects credit risk using evidence from the credit default swap (CDS) market. CDS spreads increase substantially in response to announcements of dividend cuts, especially during recessions and among firms experiencing financial distress. CDS spreads also react more strongly to permanent and less anticipated dividend cuts. The size of the CDS reaction is more pronounced for financial firms, which are inherently more opaque. In contrast, CDS spreads react weakly to dividend raises and share repurchases. The results show that the information effect of dividend changes dominates the wealth-transfer effect.

/doi/10.1287/orsc.1120.0758," We develop a simple model that links the adoption of a productivity-enhancing technology to increased vertical integration and a less skilled workforce. We test the model’s key prediction using novel microdata on vehicle ownership patterns from the Economic Census during a period when computerized dispatching systems were first adopted by taxicab firms. Controlling for time-invariant firm-specific effects, firms increase the proportion of taxicabs under fleet ownership by 12% when they adopt new computerized dispatching systems. An instrumental variables analysis suggests that the link between dispatching technology and vertical integration is causal. These findings suggest that increasing a firm’s productivity can lead to increased vertical integration, even in the absence of asset specificity."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.1070.0288," We use a unique data set to estimate the price sensitivities of households in online and offline shopping channels when the same households shop across channels. We observe households that shop interchangeably at the online and the offline stores in the same grocery chain and investigate their purchase behavior in specific product categories. Although nearly 90% of households in our sample shop both at online and offline stores, we find that, across 12 vastly different product categories, these households exhibit lower price sensitivities when they shop online than when they shop offline. Our analysis accounts for observed and unobserved household heterogeneity as well as price endogeneity. The results hold for large basket-share categories and small basket-share categories, for consumer packaged goods and nonpackaged goods, for categories that are more likely to be purchased online because of their bulkiness or heaviness, and for categories that are more likely to be purchased offline because of their “sensory” nature. Households' price sensitivities are also closely related to demographics and inversely related to how far the households are located from the offline stores. Reasons for the lower price sensitivities in the online medium are discussed."
/doi/10.1287/msom.3.4.293.9971," We consider a simple supply-chain contract in which a manufacturer sells to a retailer facing a newsvendor problem and the lone contract parameter is a wholesale price. We develop a mild restriction satisfied by many common distributions that assures that the manufacturer's problem is readily amenable to analysis. The manufacturer's profit and sales quantity increase with market size, but the resulting wholesale price depends on how the market grows. For the cases we consider, we identify relative variability (i.e., the coefficient of variation) as key: As relative variability decreases, the retailer's price sensitivity decreases, the wholesale price increases, the decentralized system becomes more efficient (i.e., captures a greater share of potential profit), and the manufacturer's share of realized profit increases. Decreasing relative variability, however, may leave the retailer severely disadvantaged as the higher wholesale price reduces his profitability. We explore factors that may lead the manufacturer to set a wholesale price below that which would maximize her profit, concentrating on retailer participation in forecasting and retailer power. As these and other considerations can result in a wholesale price below what we initially suggest, our base model represents a worst-case analysis of supply-chain performance."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2014.0921," This paper investigates the impact of individuals' social ties at organizational entry on the formation of intraorganizational networks. When individuals enter organizations with one or more preentry relationships in place, I argue they form more extensive networks post entry than their untied counterparts. However, it is also suggested that under some conditions—i.e., when quality is more certain—the relationship between pre- and postentry social structure is contingent on individuals' quality attributes. I test and find support for these hypotheses in a study of new business and law professionals. The results indicate that individuals with an initial advantage in social ties form more extensive networks post entry than those without such an advantage, and that when certainty about quality is high, this effect depends on the quality attributes of the new entrants. Implications of this study for research on social networks, resource accumulation, and inequality are discussed."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0634," In this paper, we consider a buyer who designs a product and owns the brand, yet outsources the production to a supplier. Both the buyer and the supplier incur quality-related costs, e.g., costs of customer goodwill and future market share loss by the buyer and warranty-related costs shared by both the buyer and the supplier whenever a nonconforming item is sold to a customer. Therefore, both parties have an incentive to invest in quality-improvement efforts. This paper explores the roles of different parties in a supply chain in quality improvement. We show that the buyer’s involvement can have a significant impact on the profits of both parties and of the supply chain as a whole, and he cannot cede the responsibility of quality improvement to the supplier in many cases. We also investigate how quality-improvement decisions interact with operational decisions such as the buyer’s order quantity and the supplier’s production lot size."

Specifically, after solving the model explicitly, I compute and compare the elasticities of strategic asset allocation and precautionary savings to risk aversion, robustness, and inattention.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0629," The declining cost of information technology (IT) over time provides the later entrant in information-intensive industries a cost advantage. On the other hand, the earlier entrant has the potential to build and retain its market share if consumers incur a cost in switching to the later entrant. We investigate the impact of a decline in the IT cost and the switching cost on IT investment strategies of firms. We find that a declining IT cost always hurts the early entrant’s profit. The early entrant may assume an aggressive investment strategy or a defensive investment strategy in response to a decline in the IT cost, depending on whether the switching cost relative to the extent of decline in the IT cost is high or low, respectively. A decline in IT cost also hurts the later entrant’s profit if the switching cost is high. A surprising result is that when the decline in the IT cost is higher than a critical value, a higher switching cost increases consumer surplus. When firms control the switching cost, the early entrant increases its investment in quality and switching cost and maintains its quality and its market-share leadership irrespective of the extent of decline in the IT cost."

We used dynamic modeling to address some decisions GM faced in 1997, such as the company's choice between incremental and aggressive marketing strategies for OnStar. We used an integrated simulation model for analyzing the new telematics industry, consisting of six sectors: customer acquisition, customer choice, alliances, customer service, financial dynamics, and dealer behavior. The modeling effort had important financial, organizational, and societal results. The OnStar business now has two million subscribers, an 80 percent market share of the emerging telematics market, and has been valued at between $4 and $10 billion. The OnStar project set the stage for a broader GM initiative in service businesses that ultimately could yield billions in incremental earnings. Most important, OnStar has saved many lives that otherwise would have been lost in vehicle accidents."
/doi/10.1287/msom.1050.0077," This paper addresses the strategic impact of modular design on the optimal length and price of a differentiated product line. We represent consumer demand with a Bayesian logit model. We also break operations costs into product design and production components. Our analysis shows that reducing product development costs via modular design always makes it attractive to offer greater product variety. However, reducing production costs can sometimes motivate a reduction in variety for a risk-averse producer in a multiple-segment market. We also characterize the impacts of degree of modularity and production cost on price markup and market share. Finally, we show that the optimal product line length is monotonic in risk attitude and the monotonic weak majorization, partial order on product assortment."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2017.0666," Problem definition : Manufacturing firms are undergoing restructuring defined by a collection of adjustments and decisions, which affect the source and destination of manufactured products throughout the firm’s global supply chain network. We report on a comprehensive picture of manufacturing sourcing on a global basis. Academic/practical relevance : With dynamic changes in global economic, political, and technological conditions, the design of global supply chain strategies has become critically important for executives and has great potential for operations management research. Methodology : Our work is based on a global field study conducted in 2014 and 2015 among leading manufacturers from a wide range of industries. The data set has the distinguishing feature of reflecting actual decisions that the firms made recently (during the last three years). Results : Companies are currently restructuring their global production footprints. The majority of firms engage in offshoring. Reshoring does occur but seldom for corrective reasons. China remains the most attractive site for production sourcing, followed by Eastern Europe and Southern Asia. Manufacturing continues to decline in the developed economies of Japan and Western Europe. We observe that while North America may be at the cusp of a manufacturing renaissance, such a change is not just because of reshoring by domestic firms. Labor cost no longer dominates manufacturing location decisions; rather, firms decide based on complex trade-offs among a variety of factors. Finally, firms localize production in developed economies and use developing economies as production hubs. Managerial implications : Our goal in this paper is to inform both managerial policy decisions and the academic research agenda by developing insights on managerial practices that concern production sourcing and on the factors that drive such decisions. We develop hypotheses concerning how firms make these strategy decisions, and we discuss implications for analytical and empirical research."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.16.2.129," There is widespread belief that firms should pursue superiority in both customer satisfaction and productivity. However, there is reason to believe these two goals are not always compatible. If a firm improves productivity by “downsizing,” it may achieve an increase in productivity in the short-term, but future profitability may be threatened if customer satisfaction is highly dependent on the efforts of personnel. If so, there are potential tradeoffs between customer satisfaction and productivity for industries as diverse as airlines, banking, education, hotels, and restaurants. Managers in these types of service industries, as well as goods industries in which the service component is increasing, need to understand whether or not this is the case. For example, if efforts to improve productivity can actually harm customer satisfaction—and vice-versa—the downsizing of U.S. and European companies should be viewed with concern. It follows that developing a better understanding of how customer satisfaction and productivity relate to one another is of substantial and growing importance, especially in light of expected continued growth in services throughout the world economy. The objective of this paper is to investigate whether there are conditions under which there are tradeoffs between customer satisfaction and productivity. A review of the literature reveals two conflicting viewpoints. One school of thought argues that customer satisfaction and productivity are compatible, as improvements in customer satisfaction can decrease the time andeffort devoted to handling returns, rework, warranties, and complaint management, while at the same time lowering the cost of making future transactions. The second argues that increasing customer satisfaction should increase costs, as doing so often requires efforts to improve product attributes or overall product design. A conceptual framework useful in resolving these contradictory viewpoints is developed. The framework serves, in turn, as a basis for developing a theoretical model relating customer satisfaction and productivity. The model predicts that customer satisfaction and productivity are less likely to be compatible when: 1) customer satisfaction is relatively more dependent on customization—the degree to which the firm's offering is customized to meet heterogeneous customers' needs—as opposed to standardization—the degree to which the firm's offering is reliable, standardized, and free from deficiencies; and 2) when it is difficult (costly) to provide high levels of both customization and standardization simultaneously. To move forward from the model's propositions to the development of testable hypotheses, we argue that services are more likely than goods to have the preceding characteristics. Hence, tradeoffs between customer satisfaction and productivity should be more prevalent for services than for goods. Although this classification is not precise—many services are standardizable and many goods have a service component—it has the advantage of allowing an initial test of the propositions. The empirical work employs a database matching customer-based measures of firm performance with traditional measures of business performance, such as productivity and Return on Investment (ROI). The central feature of this database is the set of customer satisfaction indices provided by the Swedish Customer Satisfaction Barometer (SCSB). The SCSB provides a uniform set of comparable customer-based firm performance measures and offers a unique opportunity to test the study's hypotheses. The findings indicate that the association between changes in customer satisfaction and changes in productivity is positive for goods, but negative for services. In addition, while both customer satisfaction and productivity are positively associated with ROI for goods and services, the interaction between the two is positive for goods but significantly less so for services. Taken together, the findings suggest support for the contention that tradeoffs are more likely for services. Hence, simultaneous attempts to increase both customer satisfaction and productivity are likely to be more challenging in such industries. Of course, this does not imply that such firms should not seek improvements in both productivity and customer satisfaction. For example, appropriate applications of information technology may improve both customer satisfaction and productivity simultaneously. The findings should provide motivation for future research concerning the nature of customer satisfaction and productivity, as well as appropriate strategy and tactics for each one. It is worth emphasizing that this is an issue that is not only important today, but certainly will become even more important in the future. As the growth of services continues and world markets become increasingly competitive, the importance of customer satisfaction will also increase. To compete in such a world, firms must strike the right balance between their efforts to compete efficiently and their efforts to compete effectively ."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.18.3.317," Baseline sales measure what retail sales would be in the absence of a promotion (Abraham and Lodish 1993), and models that measure baseline sales are widely used by managers to assess the profitability of promotions (Bucklin and Gupta 1999–this issue). Estimates of baseline sales and promotional response are typically independent of past promotional activity, even though there is evidence to suggest that increased discounting reduces off-promotion sales and increases the percentage of purchases made on deal (e.g., Krishna 1994). As a result, models that do not consider dynamic promotional effects can mislead managers to overpromote. Given the widespread use of “static” models to evaluate the efficacy of promotions, it is particularly desirable to calibrate a dynamic brand sales model and use it to establish an optimal course of action. Accordingly, we develop a descriptive dynamic brand sales model and use it to determine normative price promotion strategies. Our descriptive approach consists of estimating a varying-parameter sales response model. Letting model parameters vary with past discounting activity accommodates the possibility that market response changes with firms' discounting policies. In the normative model, we use the estimates obtained in the descriptive model to determine optimal retailer and manufacturer prices over time. The results of the descriptive model indicate that promotions have positive contemporaneous effects on sales accompanied by negative future effects on baseline sales. The results of the normative model suggest that the higher-share brands in our data tend to overpromote while the lower-share brands do not promote frequently enough. We project that the use of our model could improve manufacturers' profits by as much as 7% to 31%. More generally, the normative results indicate that i) if deals become more effective in the current period, i.e., if consumers are more price sensitive, promotions should be used more frequently; and ii) as the negative dynamic effect of discounts on sales increases, the optimal level of discounting should go down. Without our approach, it would be difficult to make this trade-off exact. Finally, we demonstrate that these dynamic effects provide another perspective to the marketing literature regarding the existence of promotions."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0670," Investment in information technology (IT) is an important driver of economic growth and productivity in the United States and other developed countries, but as yet it is not shown to be a significant driver in developing countries. Previous research suggests that IT investment and complementary assets are insufficient for developing countries to realize economic benefits. This research note examines the factors that influence IT investment in developed and developing countries to determine how greater investment might be stimulated to achieve productivity gains. We use the flexible accelerator model of investment and find that it is a good predictor of country-level IT investment. We also extend the model to include country-level variables, and find a negative relationship between IT investment and interest rates, but positive and significant relationships between investment, openness to trade, and telecommunications infrastructure. When we include interaction effects between national income levels and country variables, we find that the impacts of interest rates, size of the financial sector, teledensity, and intellectual property rights are strongest in shaping IT investment for developed countries. In contrast, we find that the impact of openness to trade is greater for developing countries, as is the size of government and education levels."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2017.1170," This article theorizes about and tests the conditions under which firms’ commitment to an industry is influenced by social movement organizations (SMOs) that favor the industry. We argue that the more prominent SMOs are within an industry, the more a firm increases its commitment to that industry by expanding its operations; yet, this main effect should be moderated substantially by a firm’s idiosyncratic characteristics. The current research predicts that a firm’s location, its sensitivity to information about the industry’s potential, and its history of associations with activists determine the magnitude of the effect of SMO prominence on its strategic commitment to the industry. We test and find support for these hypotheses using a longitudinal data set of European manufacturers of solar photovoltaic cells between 1990 and 2011.

/doi/10.1287/isre.2019.0862," Abundant empirical evidence supports the overall efficacy of social norms as a strategy to induce behavior change. However, very few studies examine how the effect of social norms is differentially manifest across individuals, especially in the contemporary socially connected digital world. We conjecture that the effects of social norms are conditional on an individual’s digital social ties and provide new empirical evidence from a randomized field experiment that included more than 7,000 individuals on an online physical activity community observed for a two-month period. In our investigation of the effect of social norms on users’ goal-setting and goal attainment behaviors, we find a significant moderating role for social connectivity: individuals with higher levels of social connectivity are more susceptible to a social norms message containing information indicating the number of users in this community who set a goal in the pretreatment month. Additional analysis reveals that individuals who have many followers (i.e., high in-degree) but do not follow many others (low out-degree) are the most susceptible to the social norms treatment. Strikingly, we find that social norms also lead to a substantially lower rate of goal attainment compared with the control message that simply highlights the benefits of setting a goal. This adverse effect is also heterogeneously experienced, conditional on the number of social ties. Our findings have important implications for the design of interventions based on social norms."
/doi/10.1287/opre.2018.1802," We consider a firm that dynamically chooses its effort to develop a product for a network of customers represented by a connected graph. The technology of the product evolves as a real-valued stochastic process that depends on the firm’s dynamic efforts over time. In addition to dynamically choosing its development effort, the firm chooses when to launch or abandon the product. If the firm launches the product, the firm also chooses a selling price, a promotional price, and a target customer to offer the promotion to. Once the target customer adopts the product, the product diffuses over the customer network based on the topology of the graph and the selling price. The product provides local network benefits to its adopters. The expected local network benefit of adoption is proportional to the number of neighbor customers that have already adopted the product. In a continuous-time setting, we explicitly solve the firm’s jointly optimal development, launch, and post-launch strategies for any connected network. We introduce metrics that allow ordering customer networks with respect to the firm’s optimal expected discounted profit, launch technology, and consumer surplus. We also analyze various extensions, including multiple target customers, heterogeneity in customer demand, and heterogeneity in benefit distributions.

/doi/10.1287/isre.11.2.197.11778," For more than a decade NEC dominated the Japanese PC market with its PC-98 architecture, which was incompatible both with its major Japanese rivals and the global PC standard. However, NEC was powerless to prevent the introduction of Japanese versions of Windows 3.1 and 95 that ran on its competitors' architectures as well as on the PC-98, unifying the Japanese PC market and creating a common set of application programming interfaces for all Intel-based Japanese PCs. The introduction of Windows rendered obsolete the large DOS-based software library that had provided strong positive externalities for the NEC architecture. Absent those advantages, the market share of the PC-98 standard fell from 60% to 33% in five years, and NEC finally abandoned the PC-98 in favor of the global standard. An examination of the unusual rise and fall of the PC-98 shows how victory in a standards competition can be negated by the introduction of a new architectural layer that spans two or more previously incompatible architectures."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2021.1434," How do we reconcile misalignments between a system’s existing normative and cognitive elements and novel regulatory change? Prior work either largely focuses only on regulatory change or analyzes normative and cognitive barriers in parallel to rather than in interaction with regulatory change. Moreover, the institutional entrepreneurship literature that focuses on reconciling such misalignments is predominantly centered on the tactics of entrepreneurs rather than the support provided by institutional carriers. We, therefore, use the case of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Knowledge Innovation Program (KIP) to better understand these neglected facets of institutional change. Through a mixed methods approach, we posit and find support for two key mechanisms that support regulatory change. First, institutional carriers (e.g., CAS institutes) clarify the market relevance of technical knowledge, linking cognitive support to regulatory change. Second, institutional carriers (e.g., science parks) create shared standards that could not occur otherwise, linking normative support to regulatory change. Finally, these changes to institutions seem particularly associated with more nascent clusters. Our study contributes to studies at the nexus between institutional change and entrepreneurship by highlighting the role of linking cognitive and normative support to regulatory changes aimed at increasing entrepreneurship."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.48.9.1175.175," Several studies have demonstrated an order-of-entry effect on market share, suggesting that pioneers outperform later entrants. However, other research has pointed out the limitations of these studies and found evidence that many pioneers fail or have low market share. Given this background, the purpose of this research is to understand the conditions under which pioneers are more likely and also less likely to have an advantage. We propose a game-theoretic model that includes important sources of pioneer advantages as well as disadvantages. Specifically, we incorporate a pioneer advantage due to preemption in markets with heterogeneous tastes. In addition, we incorporate a potential pioneer disadvantage due to technology vintage effects, where later entrants utilizing improved technology can have lower costs and higher quality. The model allows us to evaluate the extent of vintage effects necessary to overcome a pioneer's advantage. Key relationships are found between the magnitude of the pioneer advantage or disadvantage and consumer valuations of product attributes (e.g., variety and quality). We empirically validate the model with vintage effect data in 36 product categories, and measures of consumer valuations of product variety and quality for 12 of these 36 categories. The results show that pioneers do better in product categories where variety is more important and worse in categories where product quality is more important. Pioneers in categories with high vintage effects are shown to have lower market shares and higher failure rates. Similar results appear when analyzing persistence of market leadership over time, further validating our model's major implications. We also present two case studies that illustrate key elements of the model."

/doi/10.1287/mksc.19.1.83.15183," A fundamental dilemma confronts retailers with stand-alone sites on the World Wide Web and those attempting to build electronic malls for delivery via the Internet, online services, or interactive television (Alba et al. 1997). For consumers, the main potential advantage of electronic shopping over other channels is a reduction in search costs for products and product-related information. Retailers, however, fear that such lowering of consumers' search costs will intensify competition and lower margins by expanding the scope of competition from local to national and international. Some retailers' electronic offerings have been constructed to thwart comparison shopping and to ward off price competition, dimming the appeal of many initial electronic shopping services. Ceteris paribus, if electronic shopping lowers the cost of acquiring price information, it should increase price sensitivity, just as is the case for price advertising. In a similar vein, though, electronic shopping can lower the cost of search for quality information. Most analyses ignore the offsetting potential of the latter effect to lower price sensitivity in the current period. They also ignore the potential of maximally transparent shopping systems to produce welfare gains that give consumers a long-term reason to give repeat business to electronic merchants (cf. Alba et al. 1997, Bakos 1997). We test conditions under which lowered search costs should increase or decrease price sensitivity. We conducted an experiment in which we varied independently three different search costs via electronic shopping: search cost for price information, search cost for quality information within a given store, and search cost for comparing across two competing electronic wine stores. Consumers spent their own money purchasing wines from two competing electronic merchants selling some overlapping and some unique wines. We show four primary empirical results. First, for differentiated products like wines, lowering the cost of search for quality information reduced price sensitivity. Second, price sensitivity for wines common to both stores increased when cross-store comparison was made easy, as many analysts have assumed. However, easy cross-store comparison had no effect on price sensitivity for unique wines. Third, making information environments more transparent by lowering all three search costs produced welfare gains for consumers. They liked the shopping experience more, selected wines they liked more in subsequent tasting, and their retention probability was higher when they were contacted two months later and invited to continue using the electronic shopping service from home. Fourth, we examined the implications of these results for manufacturers and examined how market shares of wines sold by two stores or one were affected by search costs. When store comparison was difficult, results showed that the market share of common wines was proportional to share of distribution; but when store comparison was made easy, the market share returns to distribution decreased signi.cantly. All these results suggest incentives for retailers carrying differentiated goods to make information environments maximally transparent, but to avoid price competition by carrying more unique merchandise."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2018.3172," We examine the association between managers’ expertise and their discretionary bonus decisions in a hospital setting. We hypothesize that high-expertise managers make decisions that encourage cooperation among their subordinates. However, low-expertise managers cannot do so because their lower levels of knowledge, experience, and domain expertise prevent them from having sufficient personal influence to persuade other professionals to cooperate. We find that high-expertise managers make two types of bonus decisions: (1) keep a smaller share of the bonus pool than what they are entitled to retain and (2) allocate the remainder to subordinates more evenly after adjusting for the underlying heterogeneity in their productivity. We also find evidence that high-expertise managers whose bonus decisions reflect their support for cooperation have higher department performance than all other managers.

We show that these hybrid entrepreneurs represent a significant share of all entrepreneurial activity. Theoretical arguments are proposed to suggest why hybrid entrants are distinct from self-employment entrants, and why hybrid entry may facilitate subsequent entry into full self-employment. We demonstrate that there are significant theoretical and empirical consequences for this group and our understanding of self-employment entry and labor market dynamics. Using matched employee–employer data over eight years, we test the model on a population of Swedish wage earners in the knowledge-intensive sector."

Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science 36 (1) 1–10.]) is an alternative to the traditional, goods-dominant (G-D) paradigm for understanding economic exchange and value creation. This service-centered view is based on the idea that service – the application of competences for the benefit of another – is the basis of all exchange.

This paper discusses S-D logic as a foundation for service science by reviewing the foundational premises of S-D logic and clarifying several misinterpretations related to (1) the S-D logic meaning of “service,” (2) the role of service in economic exchange, and (3) the nature of value cocreation. Drawing on these clarifications, implications of an S-D logic foundation for service science are proposed.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.45.5.641," When confronted with the task of developing a new product, a firm chooses either to design new components, unique to the product application, or to select components from those offered in the catalogs of suppliers or from those already in use in its other products. We call this the design-select decision. The benefits of selecting an existing component include minimizing investment, exploiting economies of scale, and preserving organizational focus. On the other hand, designing product-specific components allows a firm to (a) maximize product performance with respect to holistic customer requirements—those requirements that arise in a complex way from most of the components of a product; (b) minimize the size and mass of a product; and (c) minimize the true variable costs of production. When these benefits exceed those from selecting existing components, firms will tend to design product-specific components. Our approach is to develop this theory by linking concepts from marketing, technological innovation, and engineering design. This theory yields four testable hypotheses. A cross-sectional analysis of 225 products finds substantial support for the theory."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2020.1366," This virtual special issue (VSI) collects together 19 papers published in Organization Science that explore how organizations learn from crises. The objective is to discuss insights that can help us understand the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, implications that existing research carries for organizations’ abilities to keep hard-earned lessons after the storm passes, and opportunities that the current phenomenon offers for future inquiry in this domain. Organizations, large and small, in scores of countries, have suspended normal operations. To survive, many organizations have adapted by shifting almost all human-to-human interactions online while facing an ethical dilemma and a tense tradeoff between public health and economic well-being. We take stock of the research on organizational learning from crises, summarize useful knowledge for managing the current crisis, and provide directions for future research."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1120.1538," In this paper, I investigate the outcome of a price competition between two firms, each producing two complementary products. Specifically, I study each firm's decision to coordinate price promotions of its products. Consumers are divided into loyals, who purchase both products from their preferred firm, and heterogeneous switchers, who choose between four possible bundles or buy a product in a single category. The switchers are willing to pay some price premium in order to purchase two complementary products that share the same brand name and are produced by the same firm, because they believe that these products are a better match than two complementary products with different brand names. I find that each firm predominantly promotes its complementary products together. This finding is correlationally supported by data in the shampoo and conditioner and in the cake mix and cake frosting categories. This paper was accepted by Pradeep Chintagunta, marketing."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2019.0774," Problem definition : We bound the value of collaboration in a decentralized multisupplier multiretailer setting, where several suppliers ship to several retailers through a shared warehouse, and outbound trucks from the warehouse contain the products of multiple suppliers. Academic/practical relevance : In an emerging trend in the grocery industry, multiple suppliers and retailers share a warehouse to facilitate horizontal collaboration, lower transportation costs, and increase delivery frequencies. Thus far, these so-called mixing and consolidation centers are operated in a decentralized manner, with little effort to coordinate shipments from multiple suppliers with shipments to multiple retailers. Facilitating collaboration in this setting would be challenging (both technically and in terms of the level of trust that would be necessary), so it is useful to understand the potential gains of collaboration. Methodology : We extend the classic one-warehouse multiretailer analysis to incorporate multiple suppliers and per-truck outbound transportation cost from the warehouse and develop a cost lower bound on centralized operation as benchmark. We then analyze decentralized versions of the system, in which each retailer and each supplier maximizes his or her own utility in a variety of settings, and we analytically bound the ratio of the cost of decentralized to centralized operation to bound the loss resulting from decentralization. Results : We find analytical bounds on the performance of several decentralized policies. The best, a decentralized zero-inventory ordering policy, has a cost ratio when compared with a lower bound on the centralized policy of no more than 3/2. In computational studies, we find that costs of decentralized policies are even closer to those of centralized policies. Managerial implications : Easy-to-implement decentralized policies are efficient and effective in this setting, suggesting that centralization (and thus a potentially complex and expensive coordination effort) is unlikely to result in significant benefits."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1120.1671," In the United States, end-stage liver disease patients join a waiting list and then make accept/reject decisions for transplantation as deceased-donor organs are offered to them over time. These decisions are largely influenced by the patient's prospect for future offers, which can be ascertained most accurately by knowing the entire composition of the waiting list. Under the current transplantation system, however, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), in an effort to strike a balance between privacy and transparency, only publishes an aggregated version of the waiting list. However, it is not clear whether the published information is good enough (compared with perfect information) to help patients make optimal decisions that maximize their individual life expectancies. We provide a novel model of this accept/reject problem from an individual patient's perspective using a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) framework, which incorporates the imperfect waiting list information as published currently into the patient's decision making. We analyze structural properties of this model. In particular, we establish conditions that guarantee a monotone value function and a threshold-type optimal policy with respect to the partially observable rank state that captures the imperfect waiting list information. Furthermore, we develop an improved solution methodology to solve a generic POMDP model. This solution method guarantees, for any fixed grid, the best possible approximation to the optimal value function by solving linear programs to compute the optimal weights used for the approximation. Finally, we compare, in a clinically driven numerical study, the results of this model with those of an existing Markov decision process model that differs from our model in assuming the availability of perfect waiting list information. This comparison allows us to assess the quality of the published imperfect information as measured by a patient's so-called price of privacy (i.e., the opportunity loss in expected life days due to a lack of perfect waiting list information). Previous work estimates a significant loss in a patient's life expectancy, on average, when the patient has no waiting list information compared with full information. In this paper, we find that the currently published partial information is nearly sufficient to eliminate this loss, resulting in a negligible price of privacy and supporting current UNOS practice.

/doi/10.1287/opre.2018.1781," In a competitive environment, we consider the problem faced by a service firm that makes decisions with respect to both the location and service levels of its facilities, taking into account that users patronize the facility that maximizes their individual utility, expressed as the sum of travel time, queueing delay, and a random term. This situation can be modelled as a bilevel program that involves discrete and continuous variables as well as linear and nonlinear (convex and nonconvex) functions. We design for its solution an algorithm based on piecewise linear approximation as well as a matheuristic that exploits the very structure of the problem.

/doi/10.1287/orsc.1100.0575," We consider how a social psychological bias referred to as pluralistic ignorance occurs among security analysts and how this bias may lead to behavioral conformity and isomorphism in analysts' reactions to the adoption of a particular organizational policy, namely, stock repurchase plans. Our theory suggests why (1) there may be a systematic tendency for analysts to underestimate the extent to which other analysts share their reservations about repurchase plans (i.e., reservations about whether plans reflect well on the performance prospects of adopting firms), such that (2) analysts conform to other analysts and issue more positive earnings forecasts and stock recommendations in response to the adoption of repurchase plans despite having private reservations about whether the plans reflect well on adopting firms. We also contend that analysts are less likely to underestimate the extent to which others share their reservations about repurchase plans to the extent that they have frequent communication ties to other analysts. Whereas prior neoinstitutional research on conformity and isomorphism has primarily adopted a cognitive perspective in which actors conform to the behavior of others based on their understandings of a particular policy or practice (i.e., they take the value of the policy for granted or infer the value of the policy from others' prior decisions), we develop a social psychological perspective on isomorphism wherein actors imitate others based on their biased perceptions of others' beliefs about the policy. We also extend perspectives on institutional persistence by explaining why constituents may continue to publicly endorse a policy despite having private reservations about the policy's efficiency benefits."
/doi/10.1287/opre.1070.0431," We study a bilevel noncooperative game-theoretic model of restructured electricity markets, with locational marginal prices. Each player in this game faces a bilevel optimization problem that we model as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). The corresponding game is an example of an equilibrium program with equilibrium constraints (EPEC). We establish sufficient conditions for the existence of pure-strategy Nash equilibria for this class of bilevel games and give some applications. We show by examples the effect of network transmission limits, i.e., congestion, on the existence of equilibria. Then we study, for more general equilibrium programs with equilibrium constraints, the weaker pure-strategy concepts of local Nash and Nash stationary equilibria. We pose the latter as solutions of complementarity problems (CPs) and show their equivalence with the former in some cases. Finally, we present numerical examples of methods that attempt to find local Nash equilibria or Nash stationary points of randomly generated electricity market games."
/doi/10.1287/serv.1.4.225," The shift in many industrial economies from manufacturing to service may have implications for the extant understanding of value creation. Service-dominant logic (SDL) poses a new paradigm for understanding the basis of economic exchange and argues that service is a true basis for understanding value creation. This service-centered perspective, as opposed to a goods-centered perspective, argues that market exchange actually is the process of parties using their specialized operant knowledge for mutual benefit, and focuses on how providers and customers interact, in order to co-create value. Using the SDL paradigm, this paper examines service-oriented entrepreneurship, where new business opportunities can be identified from the value co-creation perspective that may have been otherwise unnoticed by the goods-centered view. Propositions are developed using literature on SDL and entrepreneurship. Next, secondary cases from four companies are offered which support linkages between SDL and: (1) the identification of entrepreneurial opportunities, (2) a lifetime view of products/services, (3) redefining the role of the customer, (4) the alignment of information and goals between firms and their customers, and (5) the dynamic recombination of actors in the value creation system.

/doi/10.1287/serv.2016.0169," Studies have acknowledged the importance of providing superior brand experience and developing emotional attachment between a brand and a consumer. However, the significance of brand experience and emotional attachment in enhancing brand loyalty remains underexplored, especially in the context of service brands. The present study examines the effect of emotional attachment and brand experience on brand loyalty in banking services. This study also examines the role of gender as a moderator in the relations that emotional attachment and brand experience share with brand loyalty. Data were collected from 356 bank account users through an online questionnaire survey. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling techniques were used for data analysis. Results suggest that brand experience positively influenced emotional attachment, and that both brand experience and emotional attachment have a significant positive influence on brand loyalty. Results also suggest that gender moderates the relationships shared by emotional attachment and brand experience with brand loyalty. This study empirically establishes that marketers should consider not only the rational aspect of consumers, but also their emotional aspects. To address such emotional needs, it is crucial to provide pleasurable brand experiences and develop emotional attachment within customers toward the brand. The relationships examined in the present study have not been tested before; this is the first attempt of the kind. Thus, the associations established in this study form an important, original, and unique contribution to existing body of brand experience and emotional attachment literature."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2021.4112," Lean and agile models of product development organize the flexible capacity to rapidly update individual products in response to customer feedback. Although agile operations have been adopted across numerous industries, neither the benefits nor the factors explaining when firms choose to become agile are validated and understood. We study these questions using data on the development of mobile apps, which occurs through the dynamic release of new versions into the mobile app marketplace, and the apps’ customer ratings. We develop a structural model estimating the dependence of product versioning on (a) market feedback in the form of customer ratings against (b) project and work-based considerations, such as development timelines, scale economies, and operational constraints. In contrast to when they actually benefit from operational agility, firms become agile when launching riskier products (in terms of uncertainty in initial customer reception) and less agile when they are able to exploit scale economies from coordinating development over a portfolio of apps. Agile operations increase firm payoffs by margins of 20% to 80%, and interestingly, partial agility is often sufficient to capture the bulk of these returns. Finally, turning to a question of marketplace design, we study how the mobile app marketplace should design the display of ratings to incentivize quality (increasing app categories’ average user satisfaction rates by as much as 22%).

/doi/10.1287/orsc.1120.0776," This study addresses an apparent impasse in the research on organizations’ responses to cultural distance. We posit that cross-country differences in egalitarianism—a cultural orientation manifested in intolerance for abuses of market and political power and support for protection of less powerful actors—affect multinational firms’ choices of destinations for foreign direct investment (FDI). Using historically motivated instrumental variables, we observe that egalitarianism distance has a negative causal impact on FDI flows. This effect is robust to a broad set of competing accounts, including the effects of other cultural dimensions, various features of the prevailing legal and regulatory regimes, other features of the institutional environment, economic development, and time-invariant unobserved characteristics of origin and host countries. We further show that egalitarianism correlates in a conceptually compatible way with an array of organizational practices pertinent to firms’ interactions with nonfinancial stakeholders, such that national differences in these egalitarianism-related features may affect firms’ international expansion decisions."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1202," This paper studies a three-sided moral hazard problem with one agent exerting up-front effort and two agents exerting ongoing effort in a continuous-time model. The agents' efforts jointly affect the probability of survival and thus the expected cash flow of the project. In the optimal contract, the timing of payments reflects the timing of effort: payments for up-front effort precede payments for ongoing effort. Several patterns are possible for the cash allocation between the two agents with ongoing effort. In one case, where the two agents face equally severe moral hazard, they share the cash flow equally at each point of time. In another case, where the two agents have different severities of moral hazard, their payments are sequential. In a more general case, the two agents with ongoing effort first receive the cash flow alternately with an increasing frequency of switches and then divide the cash flow at each point of time. This study provides a framework for understanding a broad set of business-contracting issues. The characteristics suggested in the optimal contract help us analyze the causes of business failure such as the recent debacle of mortgage-backed securities."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2175," We study the alliance formation strategy among suppliers in a framework with one downstream firm and n upstream suppliers. Each supplier faces an exogenous random shock that may result in an order default. Each of them also has access to a recourse fund that can mitigate this risk. The suppliers can share the fund resources within an alliance, but they need to equitably allocate the profits of the alliance among the partners. In this context, suppliers need to decide whether to join larger alliances that have better chances of order fulfillment or smaller ones that may grant them higher profit allocations. We first analytically characterize the exact coalition-proof Nash-stable coalition structures that would arise for symmetric complementary or substitutable suppliers. Our analysis reveals that it is the appeal of default risk mitigation, rather than competition reduction, that motivates cooperation. In general, a riskier and/or less fragmented supply base favors larger alliances, whereas substitutable suppliers and customer demands with lower pass-through rates result in smaller ones. We then characterize the stable coalition structures for an asymmetric supplier base. We establish that grand coalition is more stable when the supplier base is more homogeneous in terms of their risk levels, rather than divided among a few highly risky suppliers and other low-risk ones. Going one step further, our investigation of endogenous recourse fund levels for the suppliers demonstrates how financing costs affect suppliers’ investments in risk-reducing resources and, consequently, their coalition formation strategy. Last, we discuss model generalizations and show that, in general, our insights are quite robust. This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management."
/doi/10.1287/deca.2019.0400," To develop effective counterterrorism strategies, it is important to understand the capabilities and objectives of terrorist groups. Much of the understanding of these groups comes from intelligence collection and analysis of their capabilities. In contrast, the objectives of terrorists are less well understood. In this article, we describe a decision analysis methodology to identify and structure the objectives of terrorists based on the statements and writings of their leaders. This methodology was applied in three case studies, resulting in the three objectives hierarchies of al-Qaeda, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and Hezbollah. In this article, we propose a method to compare the three objectives hierarchies, highlight their key differences, and draw conclusions about effective counterterrorism strategies. We find that all three terrorist groups have a wide range of objectives going far beyond the objective of killing and terrorizing people in the non-Muslim world. Among the shared objectives are destroying Israel and expelling Western powers from the Middle East. All three groups share the ambition to become a leader in the Islamic world. Key distinctions are the territorial ambitions of ISIL and Hezbollah versus the large-scale attack objectives of al-Qaeda. Objectives specific to ISIL are the establishment of a caliphate in Iraq and Syria and the re-creation of the power of Sunni Islam. Hezbollah has unique objectives related to the establishment of a Palestine State and to maintain the relationship with and support of Iran and Syria. Al-Qaeda’s objectives remain focused on large-scale attacks in the West. We also note a recent shift to provide support for small-scale attacks in the West by both al-Qaeda and ISIL. Our method can be used for comparing objectives hierarchies of different organizations as well as for comparing objectives hierarchies over time of one organization."

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1120.1693," We analyze the interaction of firm product quality and pricing decisions with financial distress and bankruptcy in the airline industry. We consider an airline's choices of quality and price as dynamic decisions that trade off current cash flows for future revenue. We examine how airline mishandled baggage, on-time performance, and pricing are related to financial distress and bankruptcy, controlling for the endogeneity of financial distress and bankruptcy. We find that an airline's quality decisions are differentially affected by financial distress and bankruptcy. Product quality decreases when airlines are in financial distress, consistent with financial distress reducing a firm's incentive to invest in quality. In contrast, in bankruptcy product quality increases relative to financial distress. In addition, we find that firms price more aggressively when in financial distress consistent with firms trying to increase short-term market share and revenues.

/doi/10.1287/orsc.1120.0786," I examine the problem of relational hazards between repeat exchange partners and the contingent roles of trade uncertainty and future exchange prospects in moderating the potentially conflicting effects of past exchanges on these hazards, thereby facilitating or restraining the formation of relational embeddedness. On the data of advisory relationships in U.S. mergers and acquisitions from 1981 to 2004, I find that firms that repeatedly hire the same investment banks as financial advisors tend to overpay for acquisition targets, as reflected by negative investor reactions measured in the cumulative abnormal return. In addition, the degree of overpayment increases with the frequency of prior exchanges. This adverse effect of exchange history grows if the uncertainty regarding the target firm rises. However, better prospects for future business with acquiring firms help mitigate this negative effect, although this moderating effect varies across the types of exchange experience. The findings suggest that a potentially complex and nuanced process underlies repeat exchanges, which are an oft-claimed precursor of relational embeddedness, to deliver tangible economic benefits. This study contributes to the emerging literature on the “dark side” of embeddedness and, more broadly, to the sociology of markets and organizations by substantiating the contingency mechanisms that shape the value of a repeat relationship in market exchanges."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2167," Social scientists have long considered what mechanisms underlie repeated exchange. Three mechanisms have garnered the majority of this attention: formal contracts, relational contracts, and relationally embedded social ties. Although each mechanism has its virtues, all three exhibit a common limitation: an inability to fully explain the continuation and stability of intertemporal exchange between individuals and organizations in the face of change. Drawing on extensive quantitative data on approximately 450,000 microfinance loans made by a microfinance institution in Mexico from 2004 to 2008 that include random assignment of loan officers, this research proposes the concept of ”relational styles” to help explain how repeated exchange is possible in the face of personnel change. We define relational styles as systematically reoccurring patterns of interaction employed by social actors within and across exchange relationships—in this paper, between microfinance clients and loan officers. We show that relational styles that are consistent facilitate a clear understanding of expectations and thus exchange. We also demonstrate that consistency in the relational styles followed by successive loan officers mitigates the negative impact of a broken loan officer–client tie. This paper thus proposes and empirically tests a social mechanism based on relational styles that often accompanies relational embeddedness, but which may also serve as a partial substitute for it.

/doi/10.1287/orsc.13.2.162.533," A fundamental theme in comparative crosscountry research is the convergence of organizational forms in diverse national settings. In this paper we examine a special instance of this theme: the pattern of diversification across industries. A common argument is that technical and market forces compel firms to adopt “coherent” strategies of diversification. This thesis implies that there should be a convergence in the patterns of interindustry diversification in all market-based economies. An institutional approach offers an alternative view. From this perspective, when diversification across industries is seen as subject to nation-specific governance and resource constraints, countries should vary widely in their interindustry diversification patterns. To test these alternative views, we analyze the diversification patterns of large corporations from five countries: France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Our results do not support the hypothesis of a common pattern of diversification across countries, and thus reject the technological thesis. By comparing two case studies in which entrepreneurs attempted to diversify by acquisition in France and the United States, we examine how institutions and agents interact to permit different diversification patterns to arise in diverse national environments. The statistical results and case studies imply that, given the fixity of certain institutions, even if countries are subject to globalization, convergence in diversification patterns is not necessary. The results cast doubt upon the merits of stylizing the debate as a choice between technical and institutional theories of organizational choice. Rather, the study points to the importance of two theoretical statements. The first is to inquire under what conditions there is likely to be consensus on a given “means-end” rationality for a specific managerial decision (e.g., diversification). The second is to understand the structural opportunities available to entrepreneurs for diversifying through acquisitions. Iterating between these cognitive and structural considerations shifts the focus from the false debate between technological and institutional arguments to the study of entrepreneurship situated in historically given national environments."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2774," The dearth of minority entrepreneurs has received increasing media attention but few academic analyses. In particular, the funding process creates challenges for either audit or correspondence methods, making it difficult to assess the role, or type, of discrimination influencing resource providers. We use a novel approach that combines analyses of 7,617 crowdfunding projects with an experimental design to identify whether African American men are discriminated against and whether this reflects statistical, taste-based, or unconscious bias on the part of prospective supporters. We find that African American men are significantly less likely than similar white founders to receive funding and that prospective supporters rate identical projects as lower in quality when they believe the founder is an African American male. We conclude that the reduction in perceived quality does not reflect conscious assumptions of differences in founder ability or disamenity but rather an unconscious assumption that black founders are lower quality. In two additional experiments, we identify three means of reducing this bias: through additional evidence of quality via third-party endorsements (i.e., awards, evidence of prior support), through evidence that African American founders have succeeded previously, and by removing indicators of the founder’s race.

/doi/10.1287/opre.2015.1432," We study a model of collective real-time decision making (or learning) in a social network operating in an uncertain environment, for which no a priori probabilistic model is available. Instead, the environment’s impact on the agents in the network is seen through a sequence of cost functions, revealed to the agents in a causal manner only after all the relevant actions are taken. There are two kinds of costs: individual costs incurred by each agent and local-interaction costs incurred by each agent and its neighbors in the social network. Moreover, agents have inertia: each agent has a default mixed strategy that stays fixed regardless of the state of the environment, and must expend effort to deviate from this strategy in order to respond to cost signals coming from the environment. We construct a decentralized strategy, wherein each agent selects its action based only on the costs directly affecting it and on the decisions made by its neighbors in the network. In this setting, we quantify social learning in terms of regret, which is given by the difference between the realized network performance over a given time horizon and the best performance that could have been achieved in hindsight by a fictitious centralized entity with full knowledge of the environment’s evolution. We show that our strategy achieves the regret that scales polylogarithmically with the time horizon and polynomially with the number of agents and the maximum number of neighbors of any agent in the social network."

/doi/10.1287/isre.1090.0229," Prior research at the firm level finds information technology (IT) to be a net substitute for both labor and non-IT capital inputs. However, it is unclear whether these results hold, given recent IT innovations and continued price declines. In this study we extend prior research to examine whether these input relationships have evolved over time. First, we introduce new price indexes to account for varying technological progress across different types of IT hardware. Second, we use the rental price methodology to measure capital in terms of the flow of services provided. Finally, we use hedonic methods to extend our IT measures to 1998, enabling analysis spanning the emergence of the Internet. Analyzing approximately 9,800 observations from over 800 Fortune 1,000 firms for the years 1987–1998, we find firm demand for IT to be elastic for decentralized IT and inelastic for centralized IT. Moreover, Allen Elasticity of Substitution estimates confirm that through labor substitution, the increasing factor share of IT comes at the expense of labor. Last, we identify a complementary relationship between IT and ordinary capital, suggesting an evolution in this relationship as firms have shifted to more decentralized organizational forms. We discuss these results in terms of prior research, suggest areas of future research, and discuss managerial implications. *This paper is dedicated to the memory of Paul Chwelos, respected colleague and dear friend."
/doi/10.1287/inte.1120.0654," In the past two decades, California’s share of the national cut flower market has decreased from 64 percent to 20 percent. California growers’ largest competitors are South American growers; Colombia controls 75 percent of the US market. South American growers have several competitive advantages, including the favorable trucking rates they enjoy by consolidating all shipments in Miami, Florida, prior to US distribution. This paper evaluates the California cut flower industry’s current transportation practices and investigates the feasibility and cost of establishing a shipping consolidation center in Oxnard, California. Applying a simple inventory management policy, we estimate a 35 percent system-wide transportation cost decrease of $20 million per year if all California cut flower growers participate in the consolidation center. The California Cut Flower Commission incorporated our findings into an application for federal funds from the US Department of Transportation to construct a new flower transportation and logistics center in California. The state’s flower growers are also searching for alternative ways to cooperatively fund a consolidation center."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2018.3272," A key strategic decision for platforms is the extent to which they should facilitate the entry of untested new products and sellers alongside established products and sellers. Exploration by current buyers helps future buyers better value these products and sellers. This externality across buyers raises the possibility that there may be too little exploration from the platform’s perspective. On the other hand, when sellers have market power and so price strategically, and platforms extract a share of seller revenue (i.e., charge commissions), the direction of any such bias is not obvious. We provide a theory that predicts when the platform will prefer more, less, or the same level of exploration as that induced by sellers in equilibrium. Our theory can explain why platforms will sometimes have no incentive to steer buyers one way or another, or may actually want to steer buyers toward established products and sellers.

/doi/10.1287/orsc.9.1.49," The existing literature on the relationship between strategy and structure tends to ignore the legal dimension of the organization of diversified firms. Yet, there is considerable variation in the legal organization of diversified firms; while some of these firms are organized as simple corporations, many are organized as “corporate groups” in which certain lines of business are organized as separate, subsidiary firms. In this paper we argue that this variation in legal organization is observed because legal organization can significantly affect firm value. In particular, forming subsidiary firms to accommodate new businesses can protect the outstanding stakeholders of a diversified firm from increases in bankruptcy risk and liability exposure. However, forming subsidiary firms also reduces economies of scope. Hence, there are offsetting costs and benefits to adopting different types of legal organization. Changes in these relative costs and benefits over time can also be expected to trigger changes in legal organization, as well as the divestiture of businesses characterized by particular types of economic hazards."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2018.0821," Many studies have investigated why users engage in digital piracy. The theoretical explanations are particularistic, and the empirical findings are fragmented, sometimes divergent, and reveal unexplained variations of effects. Managers and academics have thus had little guidance on how to explain and combat digital piracy. To help fill this gap, the present meta-analysis synthesizes past research on digital piracy and accumulates 1,373 effect sizes from 174 studies collected in 36 countries. The meta-analysis identifies the key drivers of users’ engagement in digital piracy and tests a new, comprehensive model that integrates all prior theoretical perspectives—social influence and control, outcome evaluation, dilemma solving, and reinforcement. The model explains 42%–53% of the variance in digital piracy attitudes, intentions, and behaviors and identifies the reinforcement perspective as the strongest theory. A moderator analysis shows that the influence of key drivers varies with cultural dimensions linked to the theoretical perspectives—individualism moderates social influence and control variables, masculinity moderates dilemma-solving variables, and uncertainty avoidance moderates reinforcement variables. These findings provide guidance for future digital piracy research and also have managerial implications in terms of possible revisions to antipiracy measures.

/doi/10.1287/mksc.18.1.23," This paper provides some empirical generalizations regarding how the relative prices of competing brands affect the cross-price effects among them. Particular focus is on the asymmetric price effect and the neighborhood price effect. The asymmetric price effect states that a price promotion by a higher-priced brand affects the market share of a lower-priced brand more so than the reverse. The neighborhood price effect states that brands that are closer to each other in price have larger cross-price effects than brands that are priced farther apart. The main objective of this paper is to test if these two effects are generalizable across product categories, and to assess which of these two effects is stronger. While the neighborhood price effect has not been rigorously tested in past research, the asymmetric price effect has been validated by several researchers. However, these tests of asymmetric price effect have predominantly used elasticity as the measure of cross-price effect. The cross-price elasticity measures the percentage change in market share (or sales) of a brand for 1% change in price of a competing brand. We show that asymmetries in cross-price elasticities tend to favor the higher-priced brand simply because of scaling effects due to considering percentage changes. Furthermore, several researchers have used logit models to infer asymmetric patterns. We also show that inferring asymmetries from conventional logit models is incorrect. To account for potential scaling effects, we consider the absolute cross-price effect defined as the change in market share (percentage) points of a target brand when a competing brand's price changes by one percent of the product category price. The advantage of this measure is that it is dimensionless (hence comparable across categories) and it avoids scaling effects. We show that in the logit model with arbitrary heterogeneity in brand preferences and price sensitivities, the absolute cross-price effect is symmetric. We develop an econometric model for simultaneously estimating the asymmetric and neighborhood price effects and assess their relative strengths. We also estimate two alternate models that address the following questions: (i) If I were managing the i th highest priced brand, which brand do I impact the most by discounting and which brand hurts me the most through price discounts? (ii) Who hurts whom in National Brand vs. Store Brand competition? Based on a meta-analysis of 1,060 cross-price effects on 280 brands from 19 different grocery product categories, we provide the following empirical generalizations: 1. The asymmetric price effect holds with cross-price elasticities, but tends to disappear with absolute cross-price effects. 2. The neighborhood price effect holds with both cross-price elasticities and absolute cross-price effects, and is significantly stronger than the asymmetric price effect on both measures of cross-price effects. 3. A brand is affected the most by discounts of its immediately higher-priced brand, followed closely by discounts of its immediately lower-priced brand. 4. National brands impact store brands more so than the reverse when the cross-effect is measured in elasticities, but the asymmetric effect does not hold with absolute effects. Store brands hurt and are, in turn, hurt the most by the lower-priced national brands that are adjacent in price to the store brands. 5. Cross-price effects are greater when there are fewer competing brands in the product category, and among brands in nonfood household products than among brands in food products. The implications of these findings are discussed."
/doi/10.1287/inte.2017.0929," The New York City Off-Hour Delivery (NYC OHD) program is the work of a private-public-academic partnership—a collaborative effort of leading private-sector groups and companies, public-sector agencies led by the New York City Department of Transportation, and research partners led by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The efforts of this partnership have induced more than 400 commercial establishments in NYC to accept OHD without supervision. The economic benefits are considerable: the carriers have reduced operational costs and parking fines by 45 percent; the receivers enjoy more reliable deliveries, enabling them to reduce inventory levels; the truck drivers have less stress, shorter work hours, and easier deliveries and parking; the delivery trucks produce 55–67 percent less emissions than they would during regular-hour deliveries, for a net reduction of 2.5 million tons of CO 2 per year; and citizens’ quality of life increases as a result of reduced conflicts between delivery trucks, cars, bicycles, and pedestrians, and through the use of low-noise delivery practices and technologies that minimize the impacts of noise. The total economic benefits exceed $20 million per year. The success of the OHD program is due largely to the policy design at its core, made possible with the behavioral microsimulation. This unique optimization-simulation system incorporates the research conducted into an operations research/management science tool that assesses the effectiveness of alternative policy designs. This enabled the successful implementation of the project within the most complex urban environment in the United States."

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2578," We analyze the effect of accounting bias on the competition and market structure of an industry. In our model, firms’ interim accounting reports on investment projects may contain bias introduced by the mandatory accounting system. We find that this bias strictly decreases firms’ profits when investors do not have an abandonment option, but different results emerge when we allow the investors to divest in the interim. Specifically, a conservative accounting regime may increase the likelihood of projects being discontinued, inducing some firms to exit from the product market and leaving rivals to capture their market share. A conservative regime can thus soften market competition and result in ex ante higher investment payoff, higher consumer surplus, and higher total social welfare. Since industries often have common reporting standards, we also identify the degrees of industry-wide accounting bias that maximize the expected investor payoffs. Finally, we allow for investors to coordinate their divestment decisions when both firms report unfavorable costs and show an improvement to both firm profits and consumer surplus. This paper was accepted by Mary Barth, accounting ."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2601," The business model of low-cost carriers is now well established and accounts for a large share of Western civil aviation, particularly in Europe. To understand why it has proven so successful, we develop a theoretical model that exploits the two-sided nature of flights as connectors of supply and demand for goods and services other than traveling itself across physical space. Carriers offer flights of different quality and may sign agreements with suppliers of goods and services at the destination so as to subsidize and foster demand from the carriers’ travelers as in standard two-sided markets. Customers/travelers care about home and destination consumption and about the flight’s quality. Hence, beyond the thickness of the connected sides of the market, the quality of the airline platform has an intrinsic value to travelers. We show that only low-income travelers fly with low-cost airlines, while no-frills carriers are more likely to act as a platform than legacy airlines. We study how the degree of substitution between home and destination consumption affects the equilibrium market structure of the airline industry.

/doi/10.1287/trsc.2015.0646," Since the mid-2000s, electric vehicles have gained popularity in several countries even though their market share is still relatively low. However, most gains have been made in the area of passenger vehicles and most technical and scientific studies have been devoted to this case. By contrast, the potential of electric vehicular technology for goods distribution has received less attention. The issues related to the use of electric vehicles for goods distribution reveal a wide range of relevant research problems. The aims of this survey paper are to provide transportation researchers an overview of the technological and marketing background needed to conduct research in this area, to present a survey of the existing research in this field, and to offer perspectives for future research."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2635," The number of merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions paid fully in stock in the U.S. market declined sharply after 2001, when pooling and goodwill amortization were abolished by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Did this accounting rule change really have such far reaching implications? Using a difference-in-differences test and Canada as a counterfactual, this study reveals that it did. We also report several other results confirming the role of pooling abolishment, including (i) that the decrease in full stock payment relates to CEO incentives and (ii) that previously documented determinants of the M&A mode of payment cannot explain the post-pooling abolishment pattern. These results are also robust to controls for various factors, such as the Internet bubble, the exclusion of cross-border deals, the presence of Canadian cross-listed firms, the use of a constant sample of acquirers across the pooling and post-pooling abolishment periods, the use of Europe as an alternative counterfactual, and controls for the SEC Rule 10b-18 share repurchase safe harbor amendments of 2003.

/doi/10.1287/mksc.22.3.371.17736," There is strong theoretical and empirical evidence supporting the idea that “first-to-market” leads to an enduring market share advantage. In sharp contrast to these findings, we find that at the business unit level being first-to-market leads, on average, to a long-term profit disadvantage . This result holds for a sample of consumer goods as well as a sample of industrial goods and leads to questions about the validity of first mover advantage, in and of itself, as a strategy to achieve superior performance. We replicate the typical demand-side pioneering advantage but find an even greater average cost disadvantage , which is the source of the pioneering profit disadvantage. In an extended analysis, we show that first-to-market leads to an initial profit advantage , which, depending on the sample or profit measure, lasts for about 12 to 14 years before turning into a disadvantage. Moreover, we show that pioneers differentially benefit from a lack of consumer learning, a strong market position and patent protection. These three moderating factors together can actually help pioneers achieve a sustainable profit advantage over later entrants. Finally, we find strong support for the theoretical argument that the entry order decision should be treated as endogenous in empirical estimation."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0206," The development of the information systems (IS) literature in Management Science during the past 50 years reflects the inception, growth, and maturation of several different research streams. The five research streams we identify incorporate different definitions of the managerial problems that relate to IS, the alternate theoretical perspectives and different methodological paradigms to study them, and the levels of the organization at which their primary results impact managerial practice. The decision support and design science research stream studies the application of computers in decision support, control, and managerial decision making. The value of information research stream reflects relationships established based on economic analysis of information as a commodity in the management of the firm. The human-computer systems design research stream emphasizes the cognitive basis for effective systems design. The IS organization and strategy research stream focuses the level of analysis on the locus of value of the IS investment instead of on the perceptions of a system or its user. The economics of information systems and technology research stream emphasizes the application of theoretical perspectives and methods from analytical and empirical economics to managerial problems involving IS and information technologies (IT). Based on a discussion of these streams, we evaluate the IS literature's core contributions to theoretical and managerial knowledge, and make some predictions about the road that lies ahead for IS researchers."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2013.0872," The principles of open collaboration for innovation (and production), once distinctive to open source software, are now found in many other ventures. Some of these ventures are Internet based: for example, Wikipedia and online communities. Others are off-line: they are found in medicine, science, and everyday life. Such ventures have been affecting traditional firms and may represent a new organizational form. Despite the impact of such ventures, their operating principles and performance are not well understood. Here we define open collaboration (OC), the underlying set of principles, and propose that it is a robust engine for innovation and production. First, we review multiple OC ventures and identify four defining principles. In all instances, participants create goods and services of economic value, they exchange and reuse each other’s work, they labor purposefully with just loose coordination, and they permit anyone to contribute and consume. These principles distinguish OC from other organizational forms, such as firms or cooperatives. Next, we turn to performance. To understand the performance of OC, we develop a computational model, combining innovation theory with recent evidence on human cooperation. We identify and investigate three elements that affect performance: the cooperativeness of participants, the diversity of their needs, and the degree to which the goods are rival (subtractable). Through computational experiments, we find that OC performs well even in seemingly harsh environments: when cooperators are a minority, free riders are present, diversity is lacking, or goods are rival. We conclude that OC is viable and likely to expand into new domains. The findings also inform the discussion on new organizational forms, collaborative and communal."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0338," Technology-driven commerce channels, such as the Web, possess several unique features that differentiate them from traditional channels. The interaction between firms operating across these differentiated channels involves interesting competitive dynamics that cannot be captured by isolated models of electronic markets. This paper develops a stylized spatial differentiation model to examine the impact of differences in channel flexibility, network externalities, and switching costs on competition between online, traditional, and hybrid firms. A basic model highlighting the moderating influence of the hybrid firm on both channels is extended to account for differential network externalities and switching costs across the two channels. Our analysis indicates that while network effects as well as switching costs lead to the tipping of markets, such tipping occurs primarily due to the moderating effects of the competing channel. More importantly, with network effects an increased market share does not translate into higher profits. Contradictory to conventional wisdom, our results indicate that in a static market, consumers rather than firms, benefit from increasing network externalities, with competitive effects outweighing the surplus-extraction abilities of firms. Our results also highlight the importance of alternative revenue streams and provide insights for firms grappling with issues of channel choice as well as integration and divestiture."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.1120.0752," In many markets, a handset vendor and a service provider may enter into a tie-in for a handset to be available exclusively through the service provider. We examine when and why a service provider and a handset vendor may find this arrangement mutually profitable. We find that an exclusive handset arrangement (EHA) may serve a dual strategic purpose. By restricting its handsets to one service provider, a handset vendor may be able to induce a rival handset vendor to compete less aggressively. At the same time, the service provider may be able to essentially raise a rival service provider's handset costs by limiting the handsets available to the rival. Interestingly, the handset vendor's market share may be higher when its handset is sold exclusively than when it is not. Our results might explain why EHAs seem more attractive in some markets than in others, why some service providers have exclusive arrangements even for handset models that do not seem popular, and how some handset vendors enjoy high market shares despite having many exclusive models. Furthermore, an EHA may lower the handset vendor's incentives to improve handset quality, supporting concerns raised by proponents of wireless network neutrality."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0424," This study examines coordination issues that occur in allocating spending between advertising and information technology (IT) in electronic retailing. Electronic retailers run the risk of overspending on advertising to attract customers but underspending on IT, thus resulting in inadequate processing capacity at the firm’s website. In this paper, we present a centralized, joint marketing-IT model to optimally allocate spending between advertising and IT, and we discuss an uncoordinated case where marketing and IT make suboptimal advertising and capacity decisions. We show how these decisions can be coordinated either by reducing the value of a customer session or by designing an optimal processing contract between marketing and IT. Both the coordination methods can be implemented with only local knowledge of the IT function, yet they generate a solution that almost matches the quality of the centralized solution. We extend our basic model to consider demand uncertainty, lagged advertising effects, and uncertainties in the lead time to acquire IT capacity. With demand uncertainty, electronic retailers should reduce spending on advertising and increase IT capacity if there is potential for a demand upswing and the cost of IT capacity is relatively low. The value of a customer session should be further reduced when uncertainties exist. This is required to share the risk of excess or inadequate IT capacity."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.9.6.737," The heralding of improved economic indicators has generated worldwide interest in New Zealand's economic experiment despite the growing concern about the social repercussions of such rapid economic liberalisation. This paper argues that the compliance of New Zealanders to this economic experiment was achieved through the simultaneous development of a discourse of economic liberalism and a discourse of “the management of quality” and the subsequent cooption of the latter by the former. As an experiment for potential global emulation, this paper cautions those who pin their hopes for social justice on a common commitment to increasing productivity in the context of neoconservative economic policy preferences."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2812," We study how misaligned language between the investor and the firm contributes to the underweighting of foreign securities in an international portfolio. In particular, we document a significant U.S. institutional investor bias against firms located in Quebec relative to firms located in the rest of Canada (ROC). The differential bias is surprising given that (i) Quebec and the other Canadian provinces share the same nationality, federal law, stock exchange, and accounting standards; (ii) their regulatory filings are prepared in English and French; and (iii) U.S. institutional investors are sophisticated and located close to Quebec and the ROC. We also examine Quebec firms with different levels of French versus English online presences as well as those with CEOs who have U.S. work experience or board members or financial analysts who reside in the United States. We find that each factor affects the relative underweighting of investment in Quebec versus the ROC. Finally, we contrast the holdings of institutional investors located in the United Kingdom and France to bolster our conclusion that incongruent languages contribute to the underweighting of Quebec firms relative to firms in the ROC. This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2020.1234," Two duopolists compete on price in the market for a homogeneous product. They can “profile” consumers, that is, identify their valuations with some probability. If both firms can profile consumers but with different abilities, then they achieve positive expected profits at equilibrium. This provides a rationale for firms to (partially and unequally) share data about consumers or for data brokers to sell different customer analytics to competing firms. Consumers prefer that both firms profile exactly the same set of consumers or that only one firm profiles consumers as this entails marginal cost pricing (so does a policy requiring list prices to be public). Otherwise, more protective privacy regulations have ambiguous effects on consumer surplus."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2016.1060," Offshoring offers managers the promise of substantial economic benefits, but also comes with the risk of increased complexity and coordination challenges. We argue that offshoring firms must accumulate architectural knowledge to keep the cost of coordination of the geographically separated activities at bay. Based on a simulation model that examines the performance implications of firms’ learning strategies when offshoring, we show that such knowledge accumulation can be achieved through either a home-based or a host-based learning strategy. Our analysis suggests that the relative performance of these two strategies depends on nontrivial interactions among the costs of communication, the distance to the offshoring location, and the level of noise in the firm’s performance function. In particular, the difficulties of interpreting performance signals in noisy situations suggest that there are benefits of making changes to the configuration after the offshoring implementation (host-based learning). In contrast, when coordination costs and distance dominate, the strategy of gearing the organization for offshoring prior to separating them across country borders prevails (home-based learning). Thus, by formalizing these two learning strategies for acquiring architectural knowledge in offshoring, we show that important contingencies can lead to significant performance trade-offs in the search for new organizational configurations that span international borders."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.45.3.425," This paper describes a novel theoretical and empirical approach to tasks such as business process redesign and knowledge management. The project involves collecting examples of how different organizations perform similar processes, and organizing these examples in an on-line “process handbook.” The handbook is intended to help people: (1) redesign existing organizational processes, (2) invent new organizational processes (especially ones that take advantage of information technology), and (3) share ideas about organizational practices. A key element of the work is an approach to analyzing processes at various levels of abstraction, thus capturing both the details of specific processes as well as the “deep structure” of their similarities. This approach uses ideas from computer science about inheritance and from coordination theory about managing dependencies. A primary advantage of the approach is that it allows people to explicitly represent the similarities (and differences) among related processes and to easily find or generate sensible alternatives for how a given process could be performed. In addition to describing this new approach, the work reported here demonstrates the basic technical feasibility of these ideas and gives one example of their use in a field study."
/doi/10.1287/isre.1100.0298," We theoretically and empirically investigate the relationship between information technology (IT) and firm innovation. Invoking absorptive capacity (ACAP) theory, we introduce and develop the concepts of three types of IT-enabled knowledge capabilities. Firm innovation is examined through two observable innovation outcomes: patents, and new product and service introductions. These innovation outcomes are often labeled as competitive actions aggressively undertaken by firms to gain market share or to achieve profitability. We use secondary data about IT-enabled knowledge capabilities and innovation outcomes of 110 firms. Our data results provide strong support for our main assertion that knowledge capabilities that are enhanced through the use of IT contribute to firm innovation. The study's findings suggest that the three types of IT-enabled knowledge capabilities have differential effects on firm innovation. This study substantially contributes to the information systems (IS) research, methodology, and practice in multiple ways."
