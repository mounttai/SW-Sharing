/doi/10.1287/msom.1120.0389," In this paper, we examine the relationship between inventory levels and one-year-ahead earnings of retailers using publicly available financial data. We use benchmarking metrics obtained from operations management literature to demonstrate an inverted-U relationship between abnormal inventory growth and one-year-ahead earnings per share for retailers. We also find that equity analysts do not fully incorporate the information contained in retailers' abnormal inventory growth in their earnings forecasts, resulting in systematic biases. Finally, we show that an investment strategy based on abnormal inventory growth yields significant abnormal stock market returns."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2020.3690," This paper proposes a measure of dissimilarity between stochastic discount factors (SDFs) in different economies. The SDFs are made comparable using the respective bond prices as the numeraire. The measure is dimensionless, synthesizes features of the risk-neutral moments of excess currency returns, and can be extracted from currency option prices. Linking theory to data, we provide evidence gathered from (i) the cross section of 45 currency option prices, (ii) the time series of currency returns, (iii) estimated SDFs using model-free restrictions, and (iv) structural models in international finance.

/doi/10.1287/orsc.1100.0614," Online communities (OCs) are a virtual organizational form in which knowledge collaboration can occur in unparalleled scale and scope, in ways not heretofore theorized. For example, collaboration can occur among people not known to each other, who share different interests and without dialogue. An exploration of this organizational form can fundamentally change how we theorize about knowledge collaboration among members of organizations. We argue that a fundamental characteristic of OCs that affords collaboration is their fluidity. This fluidity engenders a dynamic flow of resources in and out of the community—resources such as passion, time, identity, social disembodiment of ideas, socially ambiguous identities, and temporary convergence. With each resource comes both a negative and positive consequence, creating a tension that fluctuates with changes in the resource. We argue that the fluctuations in tensions can provide an opportunity for knowledge collaboration when the community responds to these tensions in ways that encourage interactions to be generative rather than constrained. After offering numerous examples of such generative responses, we suggest that this form of theorizing—induced by online communities—has implications for theorizing about the more general case of knowledge collaboration in organizations."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1481," The existing outsourcing literature has generally overlooked the cost differential and contract negotiations between manufacturers and suppliers (by assuming identical cost structures and adopting the Stackelberg framework). One fundamental question yet to be addressed is whether upstream suppliers' cost efficiency is always beneficial to downstream manufacturers in the presence of competition and negotiations . In other words, does low cost outsourcing always lead to a win–win outcome? To answer this question, we adopt a multiunit bilateral bargaining framework to investigate competing manufacturers' sourcing decisions. We analyze two supply chain structures: one-to-one channels, in which each manufacturer may outsource to an exclusive supplier; and one-to-two channels, in which each manufacturer may outsource to a common supplier. We show that, under both structures, low cost outsourcing may lead to a win–lose outcome in which the suppliers gain and the manufacturers lose. This happens because suppliers' cost advantage may backfire on competing manufacturers through two negative effects. First, a decrease of upstream cost weakens a manufacturer's bargaining position by reducing her disagreement payoff (i.e., her insourcing profit) because the competing manufacturer can obtain a low cost position through outsourcing. Second, in one-to-two channels, the common supplier's bargaining position is strengthened with a lower cost because his disagreement payoff increases (i.e., his profit from serving only one manufacturer increases). The endogeneity of disagreement payoffs in our model highlights the importance of modeling firm negotiations under competition. Moreover, we identify an interesting bargaining externality between competing manufacturers when they outsource to a common supplier. Because the supplier engages in two negotiations, his share of profit from the trade with one manufacturer affects the total surplus of the trade with the other manufacturer. Because of this externality, surprisingly, as a manufacturer's bargaining power decreases, her profit under outsourcing may increase and it may be more likely for her to outsource.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0511," This paper examines how the knowledge-based view (KBV) can be applied to firm boundary decisions and the performance implications of those decisions. At the center of the paper is a theoretical and empirical examination of how firms most efficiently organize to solve different types of problems related to technological development, using the semiconductor industry as the empirical setting. Measures that capture important dimensions of performance support the proposition that organization affects performance in problem solving related to knowledge development. Integrated firms realize performance advantages when problem solving in technological development is ill structured and complex, while the same is true for specialized firms when problem solving in technological development is well structured and simple. Performance differences also arise from the presence of scale economies and scope economies."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2018.3254," We investigate the effect of auditing on promoting exports for private firms in emerging markets. Using a sample of private firms from 125 countries between 2006 and 2015, we show that firms that have their financial statements audited have more exports than firms that do not have their financial statements audited. To infer causality, we employ a regression discontinuity design (RDD). Using the discontinuity around the mandatory financial audit threshold, we find that firms slightly above the threshold have more exports than do firms that are slightly below the threshold. We also exploit the countries with exogenous regulation shocks to the mandatory audits. Using the difference-in-differences (DiD) design, we find that firms that are exempted from mandatory audits have less exports subsequent to the regulation change. Further analyses reveal that the effect of auditing is more pronounced in countries with higher audit quality and for firms with limited alternative information. Our findings suggest that the auditing function promotes exports—an important economic consequence for the global economic development. This paper was accepted by Shivaram Rajgopal, accounting."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2020.3656," Many operational settings share the following three features: (i) a centralized planning system allocates tasks to workers or service providers, (ii) the providers generate value by completing the tasks, and (iii) the completion of tasks influences the providers’ welfare. In such cases, the planning system’s allocations often entail trade-offs between the service providers’ welfare and the total value that is generated (or that accrues to the system itself), and concern arises that allocations that are good under one metric may perform poorly under the other. We propose a broad framework for quantifying the magnitude of value losses when allocations are restricted to satisfy certain desirable guarantees to the service providers. We consider a general class of guarantees that includes many considerations of practical interest arising (e.g., in the design of sustainable two-sided markets) in workforce welfare and compensation, or in sourcing and payments in supply chains, among other application domains. We derive tight bounds on the relative value loss and show that this loss is limited for any restriction included in our general class. Our analysis shows that when many providers are present, the largest losses are driven by fairness considerations, whereas when few providers are present, they are driven by the heterogeneity in the providers’ effectiveness to generate value; when providers are perfectly homogenous, the losses never exceed 50%. We study additional loss drivers and find that less variability in the value of jobs and a more balanced supply-demand ratio may lead to larger losses. Lastly, we demonstrate numerically using both real-world and synthetic data that the loss can be small in several cases of practical interest.

/doi/10.1287/isre.1100.0288," Online storage service providers grant a way for companies to avoid spending resources on maintaining their own in-house storage infrastructure and thereby allowing them to focus on their core business activities. These providers, however, follow a fixed, posted pricing strategy that charges the same price in each time period and thus bear all the risk arising out of demand uncertainties faced by their client companies. We examine the effects of providing a spot market with dynamic prices and forward contracts to hedge against future revenue uncertainty. We derive revenue-maximizing spot and forward prices for a single seller facing a known set of buyers. We perform a simulation study using publicly available traffic data regarding Amazon S3 clients from Alexa.com to validate our analytical results. Our field study supports our analysis and indicates that spot markets alone can enhance revenues to Amazon, but this comes at the cost of increased risks due to the increased market share in the spot markets. Furthermore, adding a forward contract feature to the spot markets can reduce risks while still providing the benefits of enhanced revenues. Although the buyers incur an increase in costs in the spot market, adding a forward contract does not cause any additional cost increase while transferring the risk to the buyers. Thus, storage grid providers can greatly benefit by applying a forward contract alongside the spot market."
/doi/10.1287/opre.1090.0718," In this paper, we study a make-to-stock manufacturing system where two firms compete through dynamic pricing and inventory control. Our goal is to address competition (in particular a duopoly setting) together with the presence of demand uncertainty. We consider a dynamic setting where multiple products share production capacity. We introduce a demand-based fluid model where the demand is a linear function of the price of the supplier and of her competitor, the inventory and production costs are quadratic, and all coefficients are time dependent. A key part of the model is that no backorders are allowed and the strategy of a supplier depends on her competitor's strategy. First, we reformulate the robust problem as a fluid model of similar form to the deterministic one and show existence of a Nash equilibrium in continuous time. We then discuss issues of uniqueness and address how to compute a particular Nash equilibrium, i.e., the normalized Nash equilibrium."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0730," Amanufacturer writes supply contracts with N buyers. Then, the buyers invest in innovation, and the manufacturer builds capacity. Finally, demand is realized, and the firms renegotiate the supply contracts to achieve an efficient allocation of capacity among the buyers. The court remedy for breach of contract (specific performance versus expectation damages) affects how the firms share the gain from renegotiation, and hence how the firms make investments ex ante. The firms may also engage in renegotiation design, inserting simple clauses into the supply contract to shape the outcome of renegotiation. For example, when a buyer grants a financial “hostage” to the manufacturer or is charged a per diem penalty for delay in bargaining, the manufacturer captures the gain from renegotiation. “Tradable options,” which grant buyers the right to trade capacity without intervention from the manufacturer, return the gain from renegotiation to the buyers. This paper proves that, under surprisingly general conditions, the firms can coordinate their investments with the simplest of supply contracts (fixed-quantity contracts). This may require renegotiation design, and certainly requires that the firms understand the breach remedy and set their contract parameters accordingly."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3319," We propose a new measure of fund investment skill, active fund overpricing (AFO), encapsulating the fund’s active share of investments, the direction of fund active bets with regard to mispriced stocks, and the dispersion of mispriced stocks in the fund’s investment opportunity set. We find that fund activeness is not sufficient for outperformance: high (low) AFO funds taking active bets on the wrong (right) side of stock mispricing achieve inferior (superior) fund performance. However, high AFO funds receive higher flows during periods of high investor sentiment, when the performance–flow relation becomes weaker. This paper was accepted by Karl Diether, finance."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2017.1079," Political advertising is controversial, as there is widespread concern about money from political action committees (PACs and super PACs) distorting the democratic process. Studying advertising effectiveness is, however, a challenging topic for several reasons, including the endogenous nature of fundraising and ad spending rates. However, the extensive use of targeting based on designated marketing areas (DMAs) creates a setting in which neighboring counties with comparable demographics receive different levels of advertising exposure. In this paper, we leverage these advertising discontinuities along DMA borders to study the relative effectiveness of political advertising on vote shares and turnout rates in 2010 and 2012 senatorial elections. We find that negative advertising sponsored by PACs is significantly less effective than that sponsored by candidates in affecting two-party vote shares and voter turnout. A 1% increase in negative advertising by the candidate produces a significant 0.015% lift in the candidate’s unconditional vote shares. By contrast, negative advertising from PACs is ineffective in increasing its supported candidate’s unconditional vote share. Further analysis reveals that the competitiveness of races moderates the effectiveness of political advertising, providing implications for those managing candidates’ campaigns, PACs, and super PACs.

/doi/10.1287/orsc.13.5.459.7811," Adaptation to radical change is central to research in organization theory, and some of the most dramatic examples of environmental change have occurred recently in transition economies such as China. I take advantage of change during China's economic reform to study the relative importance of organizational and environmental factors in producing innovative managerial response. I find that strategic choice predicted innovation in the early stages of reform, but environmental factors increased in salience over time. Intrafirm support, Communist Party connections, and a market orientation produced innovation early in reform. Simple imitation of others was also salient in early years. As reform progressed, managers increasingly imitated other profitable firms and drew on their own experience. My results inform an understanding of both the process by which innovation occurs and firm behavior in transition economies."
/doi/10.1287/isre.1050.0045," Grounded in the innovation diffusion literature and the resource-based theory, this paper develops an integrative research model for assessing the diffusion and consequence of e-business at the firm level. Unlike the typical focus on adoption as found in the literature, we focus on postadoption stages, that is, actual usage and value creation. The model thus moves beyond dichotomous “adoption versus nonadoption” and accounts for the “missing link”—actual usage—as a critical stage of value creation. The model links technological, organizational, and environmental factors to e-business use and value, based on which a series of hypotheses are developed. The theoretical model is tested by using structural equation modeling on a dataset of 624 firms across 10 countries in the retail industry. To probe deeper into whether e-business use and value are influenced by economic environments, two subsamples from developed and developing countries are compared. The study finds that technology competence, firm size, financial commitment, competitive pressure, and regulatory support are important antecedents of e-business use. In addition, the study finds that, while both front-end and back-end capabilities contribute to e-business value, back-end integration has a much stronger impact. While front-end functionalities are becoming commodities, e-businesses are more differentiated by back-end integration. This is consistent with the resource-based theory because back-end integration possesses the value-creating characteristics of resources (e.g., firm specific, difficult to imitate), which are strengthened by the Internet-enabled connectivity. Our study also adds an international dimension to the innovation diffusion literature, showing that careful attention must be paid to the economic and regulatory factors that may affect technology diffusion across different countries."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.44.7.950," We show that a modified base-stock policy is optimal for multiproduct, infinite-horizon production-inventory systems, where demand for the products is random and the products share a finite resource every period. We characterize the optimal policy for the case of homogeneous products. Because of the difficulty in computing the optimal base-stock levels for the heterogeneous case, we propose a heuristic that is simple enough for practical applications. We present numerical results that suggest that the heuristic yields near-optimal solutions."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.8.2.126," Studies of competition typically have two underlying assumptions: that competition occurs within the boundaries of industries or markets and that all firms in a market or industry are affected equally by competitive pressures. The concept of multipoint competition challenges both assumptions. Multipoint theory addresses how different levels of contact between firms across multiple markets affect competition in individual markets. Its main argument is that high levels of contact between firms across markets will induce mutual forbearance, causing multipoint competitors to refrain from aggressively attacking each other. The restraint stems from the fact that high levels of intermarket contact enable a firm to respond to an aggressive action by a multipoint rival in markets other than the one in which the action takes place. That possibility raises the potential costs of aggressive moves and serves as a credible deterrent, especially if a firm can respond in several markets. In addition, multipoint competition helps firms to interpret their rivals' intentions and signal their own, reducing the likelihood of costly misunderstandings. The authors elaborate on those ideas to examine how a hospital's degree of intermarket contact with its competitors in a particular service market affects the likelihood that it will exit that market. They find that hospitals are less likely to exit markets in which they meet large numbers of their multipoint rivals. As a result of mutual forbearance, competitive rivalry is reduced across the markets that multipoint rivals share, lessening the types of pressures that typically prompt market exit. With lower levels of competitive rivalry, markets shared by multipoint rivals are relatively more hospitable environments in which to operate and are less likely to be exited. Rather than competing intensely, multipoint rivals appear to adopt a “live and let live” approach toward each other. The fact that multipoint contact across markets may lessen competitive pressures within individual markets has implications for the contact between firms in several settings. Multimarket contact can occur across different product or service markets and also across different geographic markets, thus affording an intriguing perspective for the investigation of the rivalry between emerging transnational firms. True transnationals, by successfully integrating global operations while still addressing local market concerns, have been seen by some as having the capabilities necessary for successful performance in international competition. Perhaps transnational firms, because they have an integrated decision-making structure, can coordinate their actions to reduce competitive rivalry with each other across the markets they share. If so, markets dominated by transnationals may become more stable than the current state of international competition would predict."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1729," Contrary to offshore hedge funds, U.S.-domiciled (“onshore”) funds are subject to strict marketing prohibitions, accredited investor requirements, a limited number of investors, and taxable accounts. We exploit these differences to test predictions about organizational design, investment strategy, capital flows, and fund performance. We find that onshore funds are associated with greater share restrictions, more liquid assets, and a reduced sensitivity of capital flows to superior past performance. We also find some evidence that onshore funds outperform offshore funds, depending on the sample period. The results suggest that a fund's investment and financial policies reflect differences in investor clienteles and the regulatory environment. This paper was accepted by Wei Xiong, finance."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2021.1003," This study examines the role of text-based direct messaging systems in online labor markets, which provide a communication channel between workers and employers, adding a personal touch to the exchange of online labor. We propose the effect of workers’ use of the direct messaging system on employers’ hiring decisions and conceptualize the information role of direct messaging. To empirically evaluate the information role of the direct messaging system, we leverage data on the direct messaging activities between workers and employers across more than 470,000 job applications on a leading online labor market. We report evidence that direct messaging with a prospective employer increases a worker’s probability of being hired by 8.9%. However, the degree to which workers benefit from direct messaging is heterogeneous, and the effect amplifies for workers approaching employers from a position of disadvantage (lacking tenure or fit with the job) and attenuates as more workers attempt to message the same prospective employer. The effects also depend on message content. In particular, we find that the benefits of direct messaging for workers depend a great deal on the politeness of the workers, and this “politeness effect” depends on several contextual factors. The beneficial effects are amplified for lower-status workers (i.e., workers lacking tenure and job fit) and workers who share a common language with the employer. At the same time, the beneficial effects weaken in the presence of typographical errors. These findings provide important insights into when and what to message to achieve favorable hiring outcomes in online employment settings."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2476," We study how to optimally attract new customers using a referral program. Whenever a consumer makes a purchase, the firm gives her a link to share with friends, and every purchase coming through that link generates a referral payment. The firm chooses the referral payment function and consumers play an equilibrium in response. The optimal payment function is nonlinear and not necessarily monotonic in the number of successful referrals. If we approximate the optimal policy using a linear payment function, the approximation loss scales with the square root of the average consumer degree. Using a threshold payment, the approximation loss scales proportionally to the average consumer degree. Combining the two, using a linear payment function with a threshold bonus, we can achieve a constant bound on the approximation loss.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2041," This paper examines the interaction between venture risk, product market competition, and the entrepreneur’s choice between bank financing and venture capital (VC) financing. Under bank financing, a debt-type contract emerges as optimal, which allows the entrepreneur to retain full control of the venture and thus yields strong effort incentives, as long as the entrepreneur can service the debt repayment; however, this leads to liquidation in the case of default, making the venture’s success quite sensitive to exogenous, even temporary, shocks that may hinder debt repayment. Under VC financing, an equity-type contract emerges as optimal. Although it is not sensitive to exogenous shocks, this contract requires the entrepreneur to share a fraction of the rents with the financier, thus yielding lower effort incentives for the entrepreneur. There exists a threshold level of venture risk such that bank financing is optimal if and only if venture risk is below that threshold. Product market competition increases the value of stronger entrepreneurial incentives and thus increases the maximum level of risk the entrepreneur is willing to take before switching from bank financing to VC financing. This is a robust result that is shown to hold in various models of competition, including the Hotelling, Salop, Dixit–Stiglitz, and Cournot-to-Bertrand switch.

/doi/10.1287/mksc.15.4.379," Several studies have shown that promotions of national brands yield more effect than those of store brands (e.g., Allenby and Rossi 1991, Blattberg and Wisniewski 1989). However, the evolution of price-quality data available from Consumer Reports over the last 15 years seems to reveal a reduction of the quality gap between store brands and national brands, while price differences remain substantial. Simultaneously, the share of private label brands has increased ( Progressive Grocer 1994). In this context, we study whether we can maintain a view of the world where national brands may easily attract consumers from store brands through promotions, whereas store brands are relatively ineffective in attracting consumers from national brands by such means. We analyze consumer reactions to price discounts in a parsimonious preference model featuring loss aversion and reference-dependence along dimensions of price and quality (Hardie, Johnson, and Fader 1993, Tversky and Kahneman 1991). The key result of our analysis is that, given any two brands, there is an asymmetric promotion effect in favor of the higher quality/higher price brands if and only if the quality gap between the brands is sufficiently large in comparison with the price gap. Thus, the direction of promotion asymmetry is not unconditional. It depends uniquely on the value of the ratio of quality and price differences compared to a category specific criterion, which we call Φ. If the ratio of quality and price differences is larger than this criterion, the usual asymmetry prevails; if such is not the case, the lower quality/lower price brands promote more effectively. More precisely, our model predicts that cross promotion effects depend on two components of brand positioning in the price/quality quadrant. First, we define a variable termed “positioning advantage” that indicates whether, relative to the standards achieved by another brand, a given brand is underpriced (positive advantage) or overpriced (negative advantage). Promotion effectiveness is increasing in this variable. Second, cross promotion effects between two brands depend on their distance in the price/quality quadrant. This variable impacts promotion effectiveness negatively and symmetrically for any pair of brands. “Positioning advantage” and “brand distance” are orthogonal components of brand positioning, irrespective of the degree of correlation between available price and quality levels in the market. Empirically, we investigate the role of brand positioning in explaining cross promotion effects using panel data from the chilled orange juice and peanut butter categories. We compute the independent positioning variables, “positioning advantage” and “brand distance,” from readily available data on price and quality positioning after obtaining our estimates of Φ. We next measure promotion effectiveness by estimating choice share changes in response to a price discount, using a choice model that does not contain any information about quality/price ratios. Finally, we test the relation between the two positioning variables and the promotion effectiveness measures. The data reveal that in the orange juice category lower quality/lower price brands generally promote more effectively than higher quality/higher price brands. In the peanut butter data the opposite asymmetry holds. In both cases, inter-brand promotion patterns are well explained by the positioning variables. An attractive feature of our model is that, in addition to the direction of promotion asymmetries, it also explains the extent of those asymmetries. A further interesting aspect of this approach is that we go beyond a categorization of brands into price tiers. For instance, lower tier brands in our data may promote more effectively than one national brand but less effectively than another. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, the data presented here seem to confirm that such cases occur because the lower tier brand offers a favorable trade-off of price and quality differences compared with one national brand and a less favorable trade-off compared with the other. The content of this paper is potentially relevant for brand managers or retailers concerned with predicting the impact of their promotions. The paper is of particular interest to marketing scientists who study the performance of store brands versus national brands and may also appeal to those who wish to explore the marketing implications of behavioral decision theory. Finally, our investigation does not reject Blattberg and Wisniewski’s (1989) finding, shared by Allenby and Rossi (1991) and Hardie, Johnson, and Fader (1993), that national brands have a principle advantage in promotion effectiveness. Rather, it formalizes when this principle advantage is overruled by positioning disadvantages of such brands."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2466," Companies that source from emerging economies often face supplier responsibility risks , namely, financial and reputational burdens that the companies have to bear when their suppliers’ engagement in noncomplying labor and environmental practices becomes public. To mitigate such risks, companies can invest in screening mechanisms and design incentive schemes in sourcing contracts. Common mitigation instruments include supplier certification, process audits, and contingency payments. The interactions of these instruments are often not well understood. We first note that the effectiveness of any mitigation instrument depends on how it changes the economic trade-offs faced by a supplier in compliance to social and environmental standard, and hence we develop a model that explicitly captures such trade-offs. As a result, our model endogenizes the supplier’s noncompliance probability and connects it with various factors, including the supplier’s intrinsic ethical level that is unobservable to the buyer. We then study the buyer’s optimal contracting problem under different mitigation instruments. We find that although the process audit and contingency payment instruments can directly lower supplier responsibility risk, they, acting alone, are not as effective as the supplier certification instrument in screening suppliers with different ethical levels. Nevertheless, these instruments are all complementary to each other; when used jointly, they make supplier screening more effective and result in lower sourcing cost. These findings provide explanations for some of the observed practices used in industry to mitigate supplier responsibility risks.

/doi/10.1287/opre.2015.1364," We study a sequential model of Bayesian social learning in networks in which agents have heterogeneous preferences, and neighbors tend to have similar preferences—a phenomenon known as homophily. We find that the density of network connections determines the impact of preference diversity and homophily on learning. When connections are sparse, diverse preferences are harmful to learning, and homophily may lead to substantial improvements. In contrast, in a dense network, preference diversity is beneficial. Intuitively, diverse ties introduce more independence between observations while providing less information individually. Homophilous connections individually carry more useful information, but multiple observations become redundant."

Analytical characterizations of the equilibrium under such conditions are offered, and some comparative static and welfare effects are examined."
/doi/10.1287/deca.2014.0299," One of the standard assumptions in auction theory is that preferences can be represented with quasilinear utility. This assumption is of particular significance in reverse auctions, which are used in procurement. This paper presents an analysis of quasilinear utilities and their implications. Building on observations of scholars in economics and decision sciences, who note that quasilinear preferences may be rare in practice, the paper shows that in the procurement of goods and services, price is often interrelated with costs. When preferences can be represented with convex or concave utilities, the alternatives in which the buyer's surplus is maximized are different from those that maximize social welfare. The result is that reverse auctions may cause a significant loss of social welfare, which is of particular significance for public organizations. The analysis of concave efficient frontiers in the utility space shows that it is possible to determine deals that yield greater social welfare than the winning bids. If the winning seller is willing to share the increase in utility with the buyer who faces a loss, then these alternatives can produce, for both the buyer and the seller, utility values that are higher than the utility values produced by the winning bid."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.1080.0446," The strategy Philip Morris adopted in 1993 featured a one-time, permanent, publicly announced price cut, an event referred to as Marlboro Friday. Little is known about the impact of permanent and publicly announced price cuts on consumer brand switching behaviors for an addictive product. In the context of Marlboro Friday, we investigate (1) how consumers' brand choices are affected by a permanent price cut, (2) whether differential and dynamic effects of permanent price cuts occur for different types of consumers, and (3) the implications of publicly announced permanent price cuts on consumer brand switching behavior in the long run. We develop a dynamic structural brand choice model that allows for consumer forward-looking behavior, learning, and addiction, and investigate how consumers adjusted their brand choice behaviors before and after this permanent price cut. Using unique consumer panel data pertaining to cigarette purchases before and after the event, we provide behavioral explanations of whether and how the drastic and permanent price cut represented an effective step to encourage brand switching for an addictive product and a necessary step for Philip Morris to combat the growing market share of generic brands."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2020.1395," While there is a growing literature on moral markets that aim to create social value through market exchange, much of it has focused on how producer activism is able to legitimate new, institutionally complex, organizational and economic forms that are inscribed with competing market and social/community logics. Much less attention has been directed towards understanding how moral markets are scaled by the entry of large, established organizations. While the scaling of moral markets entails the risk of conservative goal transformation, we still know relatively little about how moral values become embedded in markets, providing an ongoing catalyst for social value creation. Based on a five-year ethnographic study, we show how cultural entrepreneurship associated with the creation of a cross-sector partnership, legitimated local food procurement by large, established organizations, enabling the scaling of the overall market. We argue that a key aspect of their success had to do with bridging the institutional void segregating local and industrial food logics. Based on our study, we highlight how this institutional void bridging was facilitated by cultural entrepreneurship that initially focused on communications that decoupled the values and practices associated with the local food logic, and subsequently, reinfused locavore values by valorizing stories and activities that recoupled those values to food procurement practices after the institutional void was diminished. We discuss the implications of our study for research on moral markets and cultural entrepreneurship."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1447," Geographic variation in consumer use of Internet retailers is partly explained by variation in offline shopping costs. Explanations for geographic variation in the efficacy of different customer acquisition methods including traditional methods of offline word-of-mouth (WOM) and magazine advertising and information systems (IS)-enabled methods of online WOM and online search remain unexplored. We estimate a multivariate negative binomial distribution (NBD) model on zip code–level customer counts from a leading Internet retailer and provide new insights into factors explaining geographic variation in the success of these methods. First, we show that target customer density explains geographic variation over and above the impact due to the number of potential customers. Moreover, the effect of density is greatest for offline and online WOM acquisitions; this suggests that density contributes to contagion, connectivity, and a hypothesized “social multiplier.” Second, when senders and recipients of WOM share consumption benefits, WOM is more powerful and compelling. We find that location-based convenience benefits have stronger effects on location-dependent offline WOM acquisitions than on location-independent online WOM acquisitions. Third, acquisition channels contribute differently to the total customer pool—offline WOM acquisitions are clustered, whereas magazine acquisitions are dispersed. Finally, separate click-to-conversion data from Coremetrics.com indicates that using the model-based predictions to target specific markets delivers a twofold improvement in actual click-to-order rates.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0615," We develop a model of consumer learning and choice behavior in response to uncertain service in the marketplace. Learning could be asymmetric, that is, consumers may associate different weights with positive and negative experiences. Under this consumer model, we characterize the steady-state distribution of demand for retailers given that each retailer holds a constant in-stock service level. We then consider a noncooperative game in steady state between two retailers competing on the basis of their service levels. The demand distributions of retailers in this game are modeled using a multiplicative aggregate market-share model in which the mean demands are obtained from the steady-state results for individual purchases, but the model is simplified in other respects for tractability. Our model yields a unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium. We show that asymmetry in consumer learning has a significant impact on the optimal service levels, market shares, and profits of the retailers. When retailers have different costs, it also determines the extent of competitive advantage enjoyed by the lower-cost retailer."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.48.4.517.209," Merger and acquisition activity has increased sharply in the last decade. It seems useful to have models that can help senior managers of bidder firms make informed decisions about the amount of premium, over the target's share prices prevailing prior to merger announcement, that can be justified on the basis of operational synergies . The goal of this article is to capture important parameters from the production side that have a bearing on the valuation of the target's shares. We show that the production characteristics of both the bidder and the target matter in a significant way. For example, if the bidder and target operate in independent markets, the bidder has flexible production facilities but the target's production facilities are inflexible, then an increase in the bidder's demand can make the target less attractive and lower the value of operational synergy."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2017.0764," Consumer ratings play a decisive role in purchases by online shoppers. Although the effects of the average and the number of consumer ratings on future product pricing and demand have been studied with some conclusive results, the effects of the variance of these ratings are less well understood. We develop a model where we decompose the variance of consumer ratings into two sources: taste differences about search and experience attributes of a durable good, and quality differences among instances of this good in the form of product failure. We find that (i) optimal price increases and demand decreases in variance caused by taste differences, (ii) optimal price and demand decrease in variance caused by quality differences, and (iii) when holding the average rating as well as the total variance constant, for products with low total variance, both price and demand increase in the relative share of variance caused by taste differences. Counter to intuition, we demonstrate that risk-averse consumers may prefer a higher-priced product with a higher variance in ratings when deciding between two similar products with the same average rating."
/doi/10.1287/isre.9.4.380," The pervasiveness of software piracy throughout the world is having a profound effect on the software publishing industry and the development of digital intellectual properties and technologies—especially in developing countries, where the piracy rates are extremely high. An economic model is first presented that incorporates the incentive structures for governments, software publishers, and individual consumers. The analytical model provides the economic rationale for the reluctance of a number of governments to aggressively enact and enforce intellectual property rights. An important proposition derived from the analysis states that the government's incentive to enact and enforce copyright laws are closely related to the size of the domestic software industry . The ensuing empirical study provides support for the proposition and further suggests that this relationship holds regardless of the income levels of the countries. Our analysis reveals that alliances between foreign and domestic software publishers through product relationships can be mutually beneficial and will provide an environment of increased copyright enforcement. These results provide a viable strategy to combat global software piracy. With strong policies on copyright enforcement, and a vigorous promotion of alliances between foreign and domestic publishers, a government can increase the net welfare of the country and help establish a strong domestic software industry. Through product relationships with domestic publishers, a foreign publisher can improve profits and operate in an environment of increased intellectual property protection. We then present a general model of ethical behavior related to the impact of behavioral and cultural factors on software piracy. The purpose of this model is to examine whether these determinants of piracy behavior are supranational and transcend cultural and ethical barriers. An empirical study involving U.S. and Indian graduate students suggests that the general model of ethics as related to software piracy is valid in the United States. However, the model results from the Indian sample suggest that additional cross-cultural research with revised models and improved scales is necessary."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2160," We consider a monopolistic firm selling two substitutable products to a stream of sequential arrivals whose purchase decisions can be influenced by earlier purchases. Before demand realizes, the firm faces a newsvendor problem for the two products with economies of scale in production for each. When consumers are responsive to others’ decisions, social influence amplifies demand uncertainty, leading to a lower profit for the firm. We propose three solutions for the firm to better cope with or even benefit from social influence: influencer recruitment and a reduced product assortment either before demand realization (ex ante) or under production postponement (ex post). First, the firm can offer promotional incentives to recruit consumers as influencers. We reveal an operational benefit of influencer marketing that a very small fraction of such influencers is sufficient to diminish sales’ unpredictability. Second, as the potential substitutability between products increases due to social influence, the firm may leverage the increased substitutability and enjoy lower cost in production by reducing product assortment before demand realization. Last, under production postponement, the firm can take advantage of the way that social influence results in demand herding and reduce product varieties by reacting to preorder information.

/doi/10.1287/mksc.2017.1046," A key conundrum facing organizations is how to adjust marketing budgets in response to the business cycle. While most firms use procyclical spending (spending less during economic contractions), academic studies often recommend countercyclical spending (spending more during contractions), which begs the following question: What is the right thing to do? The spending problem is compounded further when demand is not just driven by one country’s business cycle, but by the (nonsynchronized) business cycles of multiple countries, as is the case for tourism marketing aiming to attract tourists originating from different countries. We derive insights into the best way to allocate marketing budgets across countries under varying economic conditions. We show that the allocation decisions are driven by the procyclical versus countercyclical nature of three factors: unit sales, marketing effectiveness, and per-unit profit contribution. To study how unit sales and marketing effectiveness respond to the business cycle, we develop a transfer function dynamic hierarchical linear model. We also model the responsiveness of the profit contribution to the business cycle. In an application to New Zealand tourism marketing, we find that a reallocation of the government’s marketing budget could yield an increase in tourist revenues of NZD $121 million.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.46.8.1137.12028," It is standard practice to form predictions from multinomial logit models by ignoring the estimation error associated with the parameter estimates and solving for the predicted endogeneous variable (market share) in terms of the exogenous variables and the point estimates of the parameters. It has long been recognized in the econometrics literature that this type of nonstochastic prediction, which ignores the sampling distribution of the parameter estimates, leads to incorrect inferences about the endogenous variable. We offer a simulationbased approach for approximating the exact stochastic prediction. We show that this approach provides very accurate approximations with minimal computation time and would be easy to implement in industrial applications."
/doi/10.1287/opre.2016.1508," Existing approaches to designing recommendation systems with user feedback focus on settings where the number of items is small and/or admit some underlying structure. It is unclear, however, if these approaches extend to applications like social network news feeds and content-curation platforms, which have large and unstructured content pools and constraints on user-item recommendations. To this end, we consider the design of recommendation systems in content-rich setting—where the number of items and the number of item-views by users are of a similar order and an access graph constrains which user is allowed to see which item. In this setting, we propose recommendation algorithms that effectively exploit the access graph, and characterize how their performance depends on the graph topology. Our results demonstrate the importance of serendipity in exploration and how recommendation improves when the access graph has higher expansion; they also suggest reasons behind the success of simple algorithms like Twitter’s latest-first policy. From a technical perspective, our model presents a framework for studying explore-exploit trade-offs in large-scale settings, with potentially infinite number of items. We present algorithms with competitive-ratio guarantees under both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon settings; conversely, we demonstrate that naive policies can be highly suboptimal and also that in many settings, our results are orderwise optimal."
/doi/10.1287/ited.8.1.41," One of the objectives of the stock portfolio game is to introduce undergraduate engineering students to the application of optimization techniques for stock portfolio selection. Ideally students playing the game would have basic background in linear algebra, calculus, and statistics. The general idea of the game is to present teams of students with real historical performance data for stocks with different levels of returns and variability so that they make decisions concerning the allocation of limited funds among these stocks. The game is played in four rounds within an hour-long session. The teams, comprised of no more than four students, are provided with an initial virtual investment fund, which they have to allocate or reallocate based on the information presented. The team with the most money in its investment account at the end of the game is declared the winner. Once the results of the game are known, one or more teams are asked to share their investment strategy with the rest of the group. This discussion forms the starting point for the last part of the session when the lecturer puts the investment game in the perspective of an optimization problem. At the end of the session basic principles of Markowitz's portfolio theory are presented and applied to the data given to the students."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2017.0621," To analyze incentives for investing in the capacity to generate renewable electricity, we model the trade-off between renewable (e.g., wind) and nonrenewable (e.g., natural gas) technology. Renewable technology has a higher investment cost and yields only an intermittent supply of electricity; nonrenewable technology is reliable and has lower investment cost but entails both fuel expenditures and carbon emission costs. With reference to existing electricity markets, we model several interrelated contexts—the vertically integrated electricity supplier, market competition, and partial market competition with long-term fixed-price contracts for renewable electricity—and examine the effect of carbon taxes on the cost and share of wind capacity in an energy portfolio. We find that the intermittency of renewable technologies drives the effectiveness of carbon pricing mechanisms, which suggests that charging more for emissions could unexpectedly discourage investment in renewables. We also show that market liberalization may reduce investment in renewable capacity while increasing the overall system’s cost and emissions. Fixed-price contracts with renewable generators can mitigate these detrimental effects, but not without possibly creating other problems. In short, actions to reduce the intermittency of renewable sources may be more effective than carbon taxes alone at promoting investment in renewable generation capacity.

/doi/10.1287/moor.2014.0677," In the classical theory of monotone equimeasurable rearrangements of functions, “equimeasurability” (i.e., that two functions have the same distribution) is defined relative to a given additive probability measure. These rearrangement tools have been successfully used in many problems in economic theory dealing with uncertainty where the monotonicity of a solution is desired. However, in all of these problems, uncertainty refers to the classical Bayesian understanding of the term, where the idea of ambiguity is absent. Arguably, Knightian uncertainty, or ambiguity, is one of the cornerstones of modern decision theory. It is hence natural to seek an extension of these classical tools of equimeasurable rearrangements to the non-Bayesian or neo-Bayesian context. This paper introduces the idea of a monotone equimeasurable rearrangement in the context of nonadditive probabilities, or capacities that satisfy a property that I call strong diffuseness . The latter is a strengthening of the usual notion of diffuseness, and these two properties coincide for additive measures and for submodular (i.e., concave) capacities. To illustrate the usefulness of these tools in economic theory, I consider an application to a problem arising in the theory of production under uncertainty."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.1090.0423," Strategic renewal, although critical for the sustained success of organizations, has received relatively little attention as distinct from the more general phenomenon of strategic change. Like all strategic issues, strategic renewal presents both opportunities and challenges for organizations. In this article, we first define the term “strategic renewal” and elaborate on important characteristics of this phenomenon. We also bring to bear evidence that suggests that strategic renewal has a critical impact not only on individual firms and industries but also on entire economies. We then provide an in-depth example of a company that has successfully renewed itself more than once, namely, IBM. Finally, we examine several different avenues for strategic renewal, involving both content and process, and identify common themes among them."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2965," We study dynamic unstructured bargaining with deadlines and one-sided private information about the amount available to share (the “pie size”). Using mechanism design theory, we show that given the players’ incentives, the equilibrium incidence of bargaining failures (“strikes”) should increase with the pie size, and we derive a condition under which strikes are efficient. In our setting, no equilibrium satisfies both equality and efficiency in all pie sizes. We derive two equilibria that resolve the trade-off between equality and efficiency by favoring either equality or efficiency. Using a novel experimental paradigm, we confirm that strike incidence is decreasing in the pie size. Subjects reach equal splits in small pie games (in which strikes are efficient), while most payoffs are close to either the efficient or the equal equilibrium prediction, when the pie is large. We employ a machine learning approach to show that bargaining process features recorded early in the game improve out-of-sample prediction of disagreements at the deadline. The process feature predictions are as accurate as predictions from pie sizes only, and adding process and pie data together improves predictions even more. Data are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2965 . This paper was accepted by Uri Gneezy, behavioral economics."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2019.1150," The impact of aggregators on news outlets is ambiguous. In particular, the existing theoretical literature highlights that, although aggregators create a market expansion effect when they bring visitors to news outlets, they also generate a substitution effect if some visitors switch from the news outlets to the aggregators. Using the shutdown of the Spanish edition of Google News in December of 2014 and difference-in-differences methodology, this paper empirically examines the relevance of these two effects. We show that the shutdown of Google News in Spain decreased the number of daily visits to Spanish news outlets between 8% and 14% and that this effect was larger in outlets with fewer overall daily visits and a lower share of international visitors. We also find evidence suggesting that the shutdown decreased online advertisement revenues and advertising intensity at news outlets. We then analyze the effect of the opt-in policy adopted by the German edition of Google News in October of 2014. Although such policy did not significantly affect the daily visits of all outlets that opted out, it reduced by 8% the number of visits of the outlets controlled by the publisher Axel Springer. Our results show the existence of a net market expansion effect through which news aggregators increase consumers' awareness of news outlets' contents, thereby increasing their number of visits."
/doi/10.1287/isre.1100.0310," Companies that outsource information technology (IT) services usually focus on achieving multiple objectives. Correspondingly, outsourcing contracts typically specify a variety of metrics to measure and reward (or penalize) vendor performance. The specific types of performance metrics included in a contract strongly affect its incentive content and ultimately its outcome. One specific challenge is the measurement of performance when an outsourcing arrangement has a mix of objectives, some that are highly measurable and others that are not. Recent advances in contract theory suggest that the design of incentives for a given objective is affected by the characteristics of other objectives. However, there is little empirical work that demonstrates how relevant these “multitask” concerns are in real-world contracts. We apply contract theory to examine how objectives and incentives are related in IT outsourcing contracts that include multiple objectives with varying measurement costs. In our context, contracts generally share the objective of reducing IT costs but vary in the importance of increasing IT quality. We establish empirical results about performance measurement in IT outsourcing contracts that are consistent with recent theoretical propositions. We find that the use of strong direct incentives for a given measurable objective is negatively correlated with the presence of less measurable objectives in the contract. We show that outsourcing contracts that emphasize goals with high measurement costs employ more performance metrics than initiatives whose objectives have a lower measurement cost profile. Surprisingly, as the number of performance metrics increases, satisfactory outcomes decrease, which we explain within a multitask theory framework. Overall, our results provide empirical support for multitask principal-agent theory and important guidance in designing outsourcing contracts for complex IT services."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2021.1445," This 1.5-year ethnographic study of a U.S. medical center shows that avoiding loss of autonomy and work intensification for less powerful actors during digital technology introduction and integration presents a multisited collective action challenge. I found that technology-related participation problems, threshold problems, and free rider problems may arise during digital technology introduction and integration that enable loss of autonomy and work intensification for less powerful actors. However, the emergence of new triangles of power allows for novel coalitions between less powerful actors and newly powerful third-party actors that can help mitigate this problem. I extend the political science perspective of experimentalist governance to examine how a digital technology-focused, iterative collective action process of local experimentation followed by central revision can facilitate mutually beneficial role reconfiguration during digital technology introduction and integration. In experimentalist governance of digital technology , local units are given discretion to adapt digital technologies to their specific contexts. A central unit composed of diverse actors then reviews progress across local units integrating similar digital technology to negotiate a new shared understanding of mutually beneficial technology-related tasks for each group of actors. The central unit modifies both local routines and the technology itself in response to problems and possibilities revealed by the central revision process, and the cycle repeats. Here, accomplishing mutually beneficial role reconfiguration occurs through an experimentalist, collective action process rather than through a labor-management bargaining process or a professional-led tuning process."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2164," Given the recent concern on “big governments” and rising budget deficits in the United States and European nations, there has been a fundamental economic debate on the proper boundary and role of governments in a society. Inspired by this debate, we study the relationship between information technology (IT) and government size. Drawing on a broad range of the literature from multiple disciplines such as information systems, industrial organization, and political sciences, we present several theoretical mechanisms that explain the impact of IT on government expenditures. Using a variety of data on IT spending and state government expenditures, we find that greater IT investments made by a state chief information officer (CIO) are associated with lower state government spending. It is estimated that on average, a $1 increase in state CIO budgets is associated with a reduction of as much as $3.49 in state overall expenditures. This study contributes to the literature by identifying a key technological factor that affects government spending and showing that IT investments can be a means to restrain government growth.

/doi/10.1287/orsc.1090.0512," In emerging economies, firms use strategic alliances to access and learn from partners' knowledge and thus enhance their innovativeness, especially when the partners have complementary knowledge sets. However, differences in cultural and business practices, as well as a lack of trust between local and foreign firms, make it more difficult for both partners to absorb and integrate their complementary knowledge bases. In emerging economies, strategic alliances often are associated with weak legal and regulatory environments that make the integration of complementary knowledge sets challenging. Existing literature lacks a clear explanation of the effect of knowledge complementarity on new product innovativeness; in response, this article examines the moderating role of new product development process characteristics and external environmental factors. Among a sample of high-tech strategic alliances in China, new product development process interdependence and environmental dynamism positively moderate the effect of knowledge complementarity on new product innovativeness, whereas expropriation risks negatively moderate its effect."

/doi/10.1287/orsc.14.3.331.15166," Infusing hierarchies with elements of market control has become a much-used way of simultaneously increasing entrepreneurialism and motivation in firms. However, this paper argues that such “internal hybrids,” particularly in their radical forms, are inherently hard to successfully design and implement because of a fundamental incentive problem of establishing credible managerial commitments to not intervene in delegated decision making. This theme is developed and illustrated, using the case of the world-leading hearing aids producer, Oticon. In the beginning of the 1990s, Oticon became famous for its radical internal hybrid, the “spaghetti organization.” Recent work has interpreted the spaghetti organization as a radical attempt to foster dynamic capabilities by organizational means, neglecting, however, that about a decade later the spaghetti organization has given way to a more traditional matrix organization. In contrast, an organizational economics interpretation of Oticon organizational changes is developed. This lens suggests that a strong liability of the spaghetti organization was the above incentive problem: Frequent managerial meddling with delegated rights led to a severe loss of motivation, and arguably caused the change to a more structured organization. Refutable implications are developed, and the discussion is broadened to more general issues of economic organization."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2228," The growth-optimal portfolio is designed to have maximum expected log return over the next rebalancing period. Thus, it can be computed with relative ease by solving a static optimization problem. The growth-optimal portfolio has sparked fascination among finance professionals and researchers because it can be shown to outperform any other portfolio with probability 1 in the long run. In the short run, however, it is notoriously volatile. Moreover, its computation requires precise knowledge of the asset return distribution, which is not directly observable but must be inferred from sparse data. By using methods from distributionally robust optimization, we design fixed-mix strategies that offer similar performance guarantees as the growth-optimal portfolio but for a finite investment horizon and for a whole family of distributions that share the same first- and second-order moments. We demonstrate that the resulting robust growth-optimal portfolios can be computed efficiently by solving a tractable conic program whose size is independent of the length of the investment horizon. Simulated and empirical backtests show that the robust growth-optimal portfolios are competitive with the classical growth-optimal portfolio across most realistic investment horizons and for an overwhelming majority of contaminated return distributions.

We consider a two-player game where the opportunity to perform a hidden action by one player may render partnership formation difficult. In this context, we study how the assignment of partners' status to the top, middle, or bottom position of a preexisting status hierarchy affects collaboration. We find that partnership formation is remarkably sensitive to the partners' status affiliations. Collaboration is easiest when both partners share the same social status, and the probability of partnership formation decreases significantly as the status gap between the partners increases, entailing massive inefficiency.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1120.1605," Business groups are key sources of innovation in emerging market economies, but we understand little about why innovativeness differs across groups and over time. Variation in the density of intragroup buyer–supplier ties, which are common structural linkages among group affiliates, can help explain both cross-sectional and temporal heterogeneity of group innovativeness. We argue that greater buyer–supplier density within a group initially creates combinatorial opportunities that contribute to group innovativeness but ultimately generates combinatorial exhaustion that constrains innovation. Combinatorial exhaustion will set in at lower levels of density as the market environment becomes more developed because the opportunity costs of local search increase. The research introduces a dynamic argument to studies of business-group innovation. This paper was accepted by Bruno Cassiman, business strategy."
/doi/10.1287/msom.1120.0379," Airline flight delays have come under increased scrutiny lately in the popular press, with the Federal Aviation Administration data revealing that airline on-time performance was at its worst level in 13 years in 2007. Flight delays have been attributed to several causes such as weather conditions, airport congestion, airspace congestion, use of smaller aircraft by airlines, etc. In this paper, we examine the impact of the scheduled block time allocated for a flight, a factor controlled by airlines, on on-time arrival performance. We analyze empirical flight data published by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics to estimate the scheduled on-time arrival probability of each commercial domestic flight flown in the United States in 2007 by a major carrier. The structural estimation approach from econometrics is then used to impute the overage to underage cost ratio of the newsvendor model for each flight. Our results show that airlines systematically “underemphasize” flight delays, i.e., the flight delay costs implied by the newsvendor model are less than the implied costs of early arrivals for a large fraction of flights. Our results indicate that revenue drivers (e.g., average fare) and competitive measures (e.g., market share) have a significant impact on the scheduled on-time arrival probability. We also show that the scheduled on-time arrival probability is not positively affected by the total number of passengers on the aircraft rotation who could be affected by a flight delay, or the number of incoming and outgoing connecting passengers on a flight. Operational characteristics such as the hub and spoke network structure also have a significant impact on the scheduled on-time arrival probability. Finally, full-service airlines put a higher weight on the cost of late arrivals than do low-cost carriers, and flying on the lowest fare flight on a route results in a drop in the scheduled on-time arrival probability."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1106," The overuse of its currency processing facilities by depository institutions (DIs) has motivated the Federal Reserve (Fed) to impose its new cash recirculation policy. This overuse is characterized by the practice of cross-shipping, where a DI both deposits and withdraws cash of the same denomination in the same business week in the same geographical area. Under the new policy, which came into effect July 2007, the Fed has imposed a recirculation fee on cross-shipped cash. The Fed intends to use this fee to induce DIs to effectively recirculate cash so that the societal cost of providing cash to the public is lowered. To examine the efficacy of this mechanism, we first characterize the social optimum and then analyze the response of DIs under a recirculation fee levied on cross-shipped cash. We show that neither a linear recirculation fee, which is the Fed's current practice, nor a more sophisticated nonlinear fee is sufficient to guarantee a socially optimal response from DIs. We then derive a fundamentally different mechanism that induces DIs to self-select the social optimum. Our mechanism incorporates a fairness adjustment that avoids penalizing DIs that recirculate their fair share of cash and rewards DIs that recirculate more than this amount. We demonstrate that the mechanism is easy to implement and tolerates a reasonable amount of imprecision in the problem parameters. We also discuss a concept of welfare-preserving redistribution wherein the Fed allows a group of DIs to reallocate (amongst themselves) their deposits and demand if such a possibility does not increase societal cost. Finally, we analyze the impact of incorporating the custodial inventory program, another component of the Fed's new policy."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2014.0531," Millions of people participate in online social media to exchange and share information. Presumably, such information exchange could improve decision making and provide instrumental benefits to the participants. However, to benefit from the information access provided by online social media, the participant will have to overcome the allure of homophily —which refers to the propensity to seek interactions with others of similar status (e.g., religion, education, income, occupation) or values (e.g., attitudes, beliefs, and aspirations). This research assesses the extent to which social media participants exhibit homophily (versus heterophily) in a unique context—virtual investment communities (VICs). We study the propensity of investors in seeking interactions with others with similar sentiments in VICs and identify theoretically important and meaningful conditions under which homophily is attenuated. To address this question, we used a discrete choice model to analyze 682,781 messages on Yahoo! Finance message boards for 29 Dow Jones stocks and assess how investors select a particular thread to respond. Our results revealed that, despite the benefits from heterophily, investors are not immune to the allure of homophily in interactions in VICs. The tendency to exhibit homophily is attenuated by an investor’s experience in VICs, the amount of information in the thread, but amplified by stock volatility. The paper discusses important implications for practice."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.1110.0716," This paper examines conceptual issues and reviews empirical results bearing on the relationship between research approaches emphasizing organizational capabilities and those based in transaction cost economics (TCE)—or in organizational economics more generally. Following a review of conceptual fundamentals—what capability is and why organizations differ in capability—it assesses recent progress toward an integration of the capabilities and transaction cost approaches, primarily in the context of the analysis of vertical structure and related phenomena. This review suggests that progress has been substantial and that the key elements of a promising dynamic synthesis have been identified. The paper then considers issues that call for attention if further progress is to be achieved. The first of these is the role of agency, which must be seen in expansive terms (relative to standard economic rationality) if its evolutionary significance is to be fully appreciated. The second is the role of structure, or more specifically, industry architecture, which affects capability development by way of its effect on the feedback that firms receive. After drawing on the recent financial crisis for an illustration of these ideas, this paper considers the rise of interest in business models as a useful field of application, and it concludes with a discussion of the role of organizational economics (beyond TCE). We argue that, whatever the theoretical perspective at the level of the firm, analyses must reach beyond that level to grasp the important causal forces affecting capability development, firm boundaries, and structural features more generally."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2020.3928," We compare non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) in firms’ annual earnings announcements and proxy statements using hand-collected data from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We find that proxies for capital market incentives (contracting incentives) are more highly associated with firms’ disclosure of non-GAAP EPS in annual earnings announcements (proxy statements). However, we find systematic differences in the properties of firms’ non-GAAP earnings and exclusions depending on whether they disclose non-GAAP EPS in both the earnings announcement and the proxy statement. When firms disclose non-GAAP EPS in both documents, we find that non-GAAP EPS is more useful for assessing firm value. Specifically, these firms are more likely to: (1) exclude nonrecurring items, (2) exclude less persistent earnings components, and (3) provide less aggressive non-GAAP EPS. Our results suggest that non-GAAP EPS is higher in quality for investors when disclosed in both the annual earnings announcement and the proxy statement. We provide some of the first large-sample evidence consistent with the use of non-GAAP EPS metrics in both financial reporting and compensation contracting.

In a recent work ( Shah and Zaman 2010 ), this rumor source detection problem was introduced and studied. The authors proposed the graph score function rumor centrality as an estimator for detecting the source. They establish it to be the maximum likelihood estimator with respect to the popular Susceptible Infected (SI) model with exponential spreading times for regular trees. They showed that as the size of the infected graph increases, for a path graph (2-regular tree), the probability of source detection goes to 0 and for d -regular trees with d ≥ 3 the probability of detection, say α d , remains bounded away from 0 and is less than 1/2. However, their results stop short of providing insights for the performance of the rumor centrality estimator in more general settings such as irregular trees or the SI model with nonexponential spreading times. This paper overcomes this limitation and establishes the effectiveness of rumor centrality for source detection for generic random trees and the SI model with a generic spreading time distribution. The key result is an interesting connection between a continuous time branching process and the effectiveness of rumor centrality. Through this, it is possible to quantify the detection probability precisely. As a consequence, we recover all previous results as a special case and obtain a variety of novel results including the universality of rumor centrality in the context of tree-like graphs and the SI model with a generic spreading time distribution."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.49.11.1597.20583," This paper surveys the underlying theory and practice in the use of options in support of emerging business-to-business (B2B) markets. Such options, on both capacity and output, play an important role in integrating long- and short-term contracting between multiple buyers and sellers in such markets. This trend is especially important in capital-intensive industries, where improvements in fine tuning the coordination of supply and demand carry large economic benefits. Typically, such options are benchmarked (or defined) on the basis of spot market information conveyed through near real-time B2B transactions. This paper notes broad set of goods and services currently being traded in both B2B short-run markets and long-term contract markets, and reviews economic and managerial frameworks that have been proposed to explain the structure of contracting in these markets. We provide a general framework based on transactions cost economics, and we use this framework to provide review and synthesis of existing literature to explain various types of contracting linked to B2B exchanges in capital-intensive industries. The paper concludes with a discussion of implementation challenges and open research questions."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0939," We investigate the impact of rivals' product innovation and new advertising on a firm's financial market value in mature product markets. Our test bed is the carbonated soft drink market between 1999 and 2003, a period characterized by a near duopoly between Coca-Cola and Pespi. Empirically, we focus on new product announcements as a proxy of product innovation and on filed trademarks as a measure of new advertising. We find that rival product announcements decrease a firm's financial market value, and that rival filed trademarks increase it. Finally, we find that the effect of new advertising is channeled through market size dynamics, while that of product innovation operates through market share dynamics. Results are robust across different estimation techniques (event study, Tobin's q) and model specifications."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2506," We develop an optimization method for constructing investment portfolios that dominate a given benchmark portfolio in terms of third-degree stochastic dominance. Our approach relies on the properties of the semivariance function, a refinement of an existing “superconvex” dominance condition, and quadratic constrained programming. We apply our method to historical stock market data using an industry momentum strategy. Our enhanced portfolio generates important performance improvements compared with alternatives based on mean-variance dominance and second-degree stochastic dominance. Relative to the Center for Research in Security Prices all-share index, our portfolio increases average out-of-sample return by almost seven percentage points per annum without incurring more downside risk, using quarterly rebalancing and without short selling.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1102," Rivalry-restraint-based theoretical mechanisms predict that an industry's profits will increase when its firms engage in less price competition, or less direct competition, with each other. Competitive-advantage-based theoretical mechanisms predict that a firm's profits will increase when it creates superior economic value that direct and indirect competitors cannot fully compete away. But what is the interaction effect on profit of simultaneously restraining rivalry and increasing competitive advantage? Do they positively amplify/reinforce each other, or negatively dampen/undermine each other? This paper's theoretical model predicts a negative interaction effect, with potentially significant implications for theory, practice, and pedagogy."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.1040.0093," In this paper we develop a knowledge-based theory of the firm. While existing knowledge-based theory focuses on the efficiency of hierarchy in economizing on knowledge exchange, we develop a theory of the firm that focuses on the efficiency of alternative organizational forms in generating knowledge or capability. Our theory begins with the problem as the basic unit of analysis, arguing that a problem's complexity influences the optimal method of solution search and the optimal means of organizing that search. The distinguishing feature that differentiates among organizational alternatives is the different way each resolves conflict over the selection of solution trials, that is, the way it chooses the path of search. Our theory predicts that efficiency demands that these governance alternatives be matched in a discriminating way to problems based on their associated benefits and costs in governing solution search. Thus, our theory is among the first to simultaneously treat both the boundary choice (i.e., internal versus external) and the choice among alternative internal approaches to organizing."
/doi/10.1287/isre.9.3.219," This paper conducts an empirical analysis of the link between the scale and scope of the firm and information technology (IT) investments, emphasizing the role of IT in coordination and control. We extend the economic production function framework to include variables related to the boundaries of the firm, including related and unrelated diversification, vertical integration and growth options, and we estimate the resulting model on a data set based on annual surveys of IT spending by large U.S. firms, conducted by Computerworld during the period 1988–1992. Our results suggest that the level of IT investment is positively related to the degree of firm diversification, perhaps reflecting the greater need for coordination of assets within diversified firms. We further find that related diversification demands greater IT investment than unrelated diversification. Firms that are less vertically integrated have a higher level of IT investment. Finally, firms with fewer growth options in their investment opportunity set tend to have a higher IT investment, consistent with an agency perspective which predicts excessive IT investment by managers with “free” cash flow. Put together, these empirical relations between IT investments and firm characteristics help us better understand the role of IT in coordination and control and the choices firms make in information systems and strategy."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.9.3.356," Our paper develops a dynamic theory of alliances by examining certain outcome and process discrepancies that may emerge as the partners interact, highlighting issues that are especially relevant in knowledge intensive alliances, such as joint R&D or product development. Firms enter into these types of alliances to create economic value and to acquire knowledge to enhance their competencies. The degree to which the partners can realize their objectives is dependent on their absorptive capacities and the collaborative strategies adopted by the partners. Outcome and process discrepancies may emerge as collaboration unfolds. Outcome discrepancies concern the ability of the partners to achieve their economic and learning objectives. Process discrepancies relate to the partners' satisfaction with the pattern of interaction, and affect their feelings of psychological attachment to the relationship. How the partners assess and react to discrepancies shapes the developmental path of an alliance. The alliance flourishes in certain states but may collapse in others as the collaboration is subjected to environmental changes or shifts in the grand strategies of the partners. Guidelines for assessing and managing outcome and process discrepancies are suggested."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2017.0680," We examine firms listed on the Shanghai/Shenzhen Stock Exchange to investigate stock market reactions to 294 Chinese manufacturing firms involved in 618 environmental incidents between 2006 and 2013. Through our event studies, we find empirical evidence of a significantly negative stock market reaction to announcements of environmental incidents. Our empirical analysis reveals that Chinese firms with a higher government share (of ownership) and recognition of social responsibility tend to be less affected by such incidents; however, Chinese firms with stronger personal political ties (i.e., top management teams or board members with concurrent or prior government appointments) are actually affected more when environmental incidents occur. Moreover, environmental incidents caused by Chinese firms can have a significantly negative impact on the market value of their overseas customers.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1805," Who provides better inputs to new product ideation tasks, problem solvers with expertise in the area for which new products are to be developed or problem solvers from “analogous” markets that are distant but share an analogous problem or need? Conventional wisdom appears to suggest that target market expertise is indispensable, which is why most managers searching for new ideas tend to stay within their own market context even when they do search outside their firms' boundaries. However, in a unique symmetric experiment that isolates the effect of market origin, we find evidence for the opposite: Although solutions provided by problem solvers from analogous markets show lower potential for immediate use, they demonstrate substantially higher levels of novelty. Also, compared to established novelty drivers, this effect appears highly relevant from a managerial perspective: we find that including problem solvers from analogous markets versus the target market accounts for almost two-thirds of the well-known effect of involving lead users instead of average problem solvers. This effect is further amplified when the analogous distance between the markets increases, i.e., when searching in far versus near analogous markets. Finally, results indicate that the analogous market effect is particularly strong in the upper tail of the novelty distribution, which again underscores the effect's practical importance. All of this suggests that it might pay to systematically search across firm-external sources of innovation that were formerly out of scope for most managers.

This paper attempts to demonstrate that firms are selected for survival on the basis of contracting efficiency. Based on a statistical analysis of 170 new franchise contracts and interviews with the founders of 16 of these new franchise systems, we show that new franchise chains that adopt exclusive territories are more likely to survive over time than chains that do not. Moreover, successful and failed entrepreneurs possess different information about how to design contracts. These entrepreneurs undertake “contractual experiments” based on the information they possess. Those whose experiments prove to be more consistent with economic theory are rewarded for their superior information with survival."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2020," Are market leaders more likely to be early adopters of business process innovations? Although they tend to enjoy economies of scale in adoption, leaders may find that adjustment costs also increase with scale. Prior work has focused on how misalignment of incumbents’ internal capabilities may affect their technology strategy. However, technology-capability misalignment may exist outside the firm boundary as well. In this paper, I build on mainstream product innovation concepts to predict when market leaders will adopt certain business process innovations. I then test these predictions in a large data set on early e-business adoption, leveraging its novel insight into focal firms, their markets, and their customers. I find market leaders were significantly more likely to embrace new information technology-enabled practices— except when customer adjustment costs were a significant concern. These findings highlight the strategic significance of external capabilities in the face of technological change. This paper was accepted by Bruno Cassiman, business strategy ."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2015.0909," We empirically study the impact of the entry of a new theater on two important product decisions that incumbents in the movie exhibition industry face: (1) whether to invest in screening movies that are expected to be popular, and (2) when to adopt new releases. For theaters, both of these decisions feature a cost-demand trade-off inherent in quality decisions: Although screening popular and recent movies brings more patrons to the theater, distributors take a higher share of the revenue for such movies. The impact of competitive entry on the incumbent’s quality decisions is ambiguous, as it may simultaneously increase the competitive pressure to invest more in these dimensions of quality and also change the demand conditions that incumbents face. We find that incumbent theaters do not increase the provision of popular and recent movies in response to rival entry. To identify the role of competitive incentives, we study the differential impact of entry based on whether the entrant belongs to the same parent firm as the incumbent theaters. This comparison reveals that competitive incentives push incumbents to screen movies with high expected success more frequently and to adopt movies sooner. The product responses we document have important implications for the revenue impact of entry and the conclusions that researchers can draw from this impact. Ignoring the provision of these quality dimensions suggests cannibalization to exceed business stealing, a conclusion that is reversed when we account for endogenous product responses. We also show that our findings on popularity and recency cannot be explained by concomitant changes in theaters’ other product decisions, such as the variety of movies screened."
/doi/10.1287/inte.2018.0961," We propose an extraction schedule for the Chuquicamata underground copper mine in Chile. The schedule maximizes profits while adhering to all operational and geomechanical requirements involved in proper removal of the material. We include extraction capacity uncertainties due to failure in equipment, specifically to the overland conveyor, which we find to be the most critical component in the extraction process. First we present the extraction plan based on a deterministic model, which does not assume uncertainty in the extraction capacity and represents the solution that the mine can implement without using the results of this study. Then we extend this model to a stochastic setting by generating different scenarios for capacity values in subsequent periods. We construct a multistage model that handles economic downside risk arising from this uncertainty by penalizing plans that deviate from an ex ante profit target in one or more scenarios. Simulation results show that a stochastic-based solution can achieve the same expected profits as the deterministic-based solution. However, the earnings of the stochastic-based solution average 5% more for scenarios in which earnings are below the 10th percentile. If we choose a target 2% below the expected profit obtained by the deterministic-based solution, this average increases from 5% to 9%."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2017.1045," We leverage a temporary block of the Chinese microblogging platform Sina Weibo due to political events to estimate the causal effect of online word-of-mouth content on product demand in the context of TV show viewership. Based on this source of exogenous variation, we estimate an elasticity of TV show ratings (market share in terms of viewership) with respect to the number of relevant comments (comments were disabled during the block) of 0.016. We find that more postshow microblogging activity increases demand, whereas comments posted prior to the show airing do not affect viewership. These patterns are inconsistent with informative or persuasive effects and suggest complementarity between TV consumption and anticipated postshow microblogging activity.

/doi/10.1287/opre.2021.2163," Computing market equilibria is an important practical problem for market design, for example, in fair division of items. However, computing equilibria requires large amounts of information (typically the valuation of every buyer for every item) and computing power. We consider ameliorating these issues by applying a method used for solving complex games: constructing a coarsened abstraction of a given market, solving for the equilibrium in the abstraction, and lifting the prices and allocations back to the original market. We show how to bound important quantities such as regret, envy, Nash social welfare, Pareto optimality, and maximin share/proportionality when the abstracted prices and allocations are used in place of the real equilibrium. We then study two abstraction methods of interest for practitioners: (1) filling in unknown valuations using techniques from matrix completion and (2) reducing the problem size by aggregating groups of buyers/items into smaller numbers of representative buyers/items and solving for equilibrium in this coarsened market. We find that in real data allocations/prices that are relatively close to equilibria can be computed from even very coarse abstractions."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1280," We find that the enforcement of noncompete clauses significantly impedes entrepreneurship and employment growth. Based on a panel of metropolitan areas in the United States from 1993 to 2002, our results indicate that, relative to states that enforce noncompete covenants, an increase in the local supply of venture capital in states that restrict the scope of these agreements has significantly stronger positive effects on (i) the number of patents, (ii) the number of firm starts, and (iii) employment. We address potential endogeneity in the supply of venture capital by using endowment returns as an instrumental variable. Our results point to a strong interaction between financial intermediation and the legal regime in promoting entrepreneurship and economic growth. This paper was accepted by Gérard P.

/doi/10.1287/orsc.2017.1187," Personal finances are becoming an increasingly prominent source of distress for a substantial proportion of the population in many developed economies. In this paper, we examine the organizational consequences of this trend by proposing that financial precarity can undermine a person’s ability to perform at work. Across two studies, we demonstrate that people who are worried about their financial situation have less cognitive capacity available to them, which subsequently spills over into their work performance. In Study 1, we demonstrate this relationship in a field study with short-haul truck drivers where we combine survey responses with lagged archival data on preventable accidents. We find that a one-standard-deviation increase in financial worry is associated with a 0.4% increase in the probability of a preventable accident because of its detrimental effects on cognitive capacity. In Study 2, we establish the causal ordering among the variables by manipulating financial worry in a laboratory environment using a driving simulation task, confirming the results of Study 1. We discuss the implications of the research findings for organizational theory and workplace practice, arguing that it may be in employers’ self-interest to undertake initiatives that reduce employees’ financial precarity."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.1110.0692," This paper investigates how firms responded to standardized nutrition labels on food products required by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA). Using a longitudinal quasi-experimental design, we test our predictions using two large-scale samples that span 30 product categories. Results indicate that the NLEA reduced brand nutritional quality relative to a control group of products not regulated by the NLEA. At the same time, among regulated products, brand taste increased. Although this reduction in nutrition represents an unintended consequence of regulation, there were a set of category, firm, and brand conditions under which the NLEA produced a positive effect on brand nutritional quality. We find that firms were more likely to improve brand nutrition when firm risk or firm power is low. Lower risk occurs when the firm is introducing a new brand rather than changing an existing brand, and weaker power in a category is reflected by lower market share in a category. Furthermore, firms competing in low-health categories (e.g., potato chips) or small-portion categories (e.g., peanut butter) improved nutrition more than firms competing in high-health categories (e.g., bread) or large-portion categories (e.g., frozen dinners). Recommendations for firm strategy and the design of consumer information policy are examined in light of these surprising firm responses."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.1090.0449," This paper expands the organization theory and evidence on regional industrial agglomerations. We define regional economic activities according to the attributes of the organizations that populate a region and investigate how organizational characteristics influence macro-outcomes at a regional economic level. We focus on two dimensions emerging from two widely known organizational forms: the managerial corporation and the knowledge cluster with a marked orientation toward interfirm knowledge spillovers. We use an original data set of 146 U.S. cities to obtain variations in the extent to which they are populated by managerial firms or knowledge clusters. By utilizing city-level measures of managerial salaries, we test how the intensity of managerial corporation versus knowledge cluster characteristics affects the mean and dispersion of the “rewards” of cities. Our evidence suggests that higher managerial corporate characteristics lower the variability of rewards, while they have no effect on the mean of rewards. Higher-knowledge cluster characteristics produce both higher dispersion and higher expected rewards. We explain these results by looking at the different learning mechanisms of the two organizational types. In so doing, we highlight the role of intra- and interfirm knowledge processes as important sources of differences in the rewards of the two models. From an empirical point of view, results are confirmed using both patent-based and skill mobility-based measures of knowledge spillovers."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.1100.0630," The dramatic impact of the current crisis on performance of businesses across sectors and economies has been headlining the business press for the past several months. Extant reconciliations of these patterns in the popular press rely on ad hoc reasoning. Using historical data on currency crisis episodes across the world, we show that the impact of the crisis on a firm's business is best understood by focusing on the impact of the crisis on the behavior of consumers. Our analyses show that consumer behavior in a crisis is characterized by consumption smoothing at various levels—intertemporal, intercategory, and intracategory. These behavioral adjustments result in significant reallocation of consumption expenditures. More importantly, the smoothing decisions because of a crisis are distinct and independent of the impact of changes in income and prices that accompany a crisis. Interestingly, there is marked variation in the patterns of consumption smoothing across different types of economies. Taken together, these results have important and interesting implications for managers, policy makers, and academics."

In this paper, we incorporate these uncertainties into a single-product, periodic-review, finite-horizon stochastic inventory system by modeling operational costs, discount factors, and demands as stochastic processes that evolve over time. We study three stockout protocols and establish conditions under which ( s, S ) inventory policies are optimal when discount factors, operational costs, and demands are stochastic and correlated both to one another and over time. Examples are provided to demonstrate nontrivial optimal policies in the absence of these sufficient conditions."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.10.4.460," It is well established that the existence of investments specific to a relationship influences the choice of governance structure, including the use of contractual safeguards. What is less well understood are the circumstances leading to the creation of those specific assets to begin with. This paper explores the industrial buyer's motives to put itself at risk by making investments, tangible and intangible, which cannot be readily redeployed from one supplier to another. Using original data from a sample of 388 supply relationships involving all automakers in the U.S. and Japan, we examine features of the supply task, the supplier, and the supply environment which serve as motives to make supplier-specific investments. We also examine potential factors which facilitate the posting of specific assets as “credible commitments” to attenuate supplier opportunism. We find that specific investments by buyers serve as a mechanism to 1) increase coordination when the manufacturing task is complex, 2) buffer the buyer against technological uncertainty, and 3) build close relationships when the requisite production skills are scarce (the supply market is thin). We find more specific investments in supply arrangements that are embedded in a broader business relationship. We find fewer supplier-specific investments in the Japanese context. Finally, we find that buyers focus their investments on lesser-known, low-share component makers, perhaps to capitalize on a unique, focused supplier capability."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2018.0746," Problem definition: Managers introducing new innovative technological products frequently face the dual task of managing both revenues and profits. This task is made challenging in part because of the tendency of new technologies to traverse a sequentially downward path of gradually lowering costs and prices, which limits their initial availability and affordability, crimping market coverage and revenues. Academic/practical relevance: We focus on the product management challenge of juggling revenues and profits, show how it is amplified in a supply chain, and propose a new degree of freedom in a supply chain, namely innovation investment anchoring, that offers product managers and their firms the ability to expand market coverage and improve both revenues and profits. Methodology: We adopt a sequential game theory approach to analyze the investment anchor decision for various objectives from investments in innovation to market coverage to profit. Results: We find that the investment anchoring approach can lead to greater investments in innovation, revenues, and profits. We also compare the investment anchoring for two types of innovation, product quality improvement and cost reduction, and show that the investment anchoring is more effective for product quality improvement. Managerial implications: Our findings have subtle but important implications for firms launching innovative products and aspiring to expand product sales and profits. Specifically, innovating firms in a supply chain by broadening the quest for an investment anchor and offering them incentives to invest as well as fine tuning the level of innovation investment with the market context can make innovation more inclusive, alleviate supply chain distortions, and streamline revenues and profits.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3320," This paper predicts and finds that investor uncertainty surrounding a key information release event—the earnings announcement—is decreasing in a firm’s reporting streak. We use two proxies related to investor ex ante uncertainty and corresponding pricing of such uncertainty: option-implied volatilities and variance risk premiums; both are measured with maturities surrounding the impending quarterly earnings announcement. Consistent with prior research, we measure reporting streak as the number of consecutive quarters the firm meets or beats the consensus analyst earnings-per-share forecast. Empirical results confirm expectations that the two uncertainty-related constructs are decreasing in the length of the reporting streak. These results, combined with further evidence documenting that lower uncertainty leads to lower stock returns surrounding the earnings announcements, suggest that longer reporting streaks reflect lower risk during earnings announcements.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2875," We partner with a major multinational telecommunications provider to analyze the effect of subscription video-on-demand (SVoD) services on digital piracy. For a period of 45 consecutive days, a group of randomly selected households who used BitTorrent in the past were gifted with a bundle of TV channels with movies and TV shows that could be streamed as in SVoD. We find that, on average, households that received the gift increased overall TV consumption by 4.6% and reduced Internet downloads and uploads by 4.2% and 4.5%, respectively. However, and also on average, treated households did not change their likelihood of using BitTorrent during the experiment. Our findings are heterogeneous across households and are mediated by the fit between the preferences of households in our sample for movies and the content available as part of the gifted channels. Households with preferences aligned with the gifted content reduced their probability of using BitTorrent during the experiment by 18% and decreased their amount of upload traffic by 45%. We also show using simulation that the size of the SVoD catalog and licensing window restrictions limit significantly the ability of content providers to match SVoD offerings to the preferences of BitTorrent users. Finally, we estimate that households in our sample are willing to pay at most $3.25 USD per month to access a SVoD catalog as large as Netflix’s in the United States. Together, our results show that, as a stand-alone strategy, using legal SVoD to curtail piracy will require, at the minimum, offering content much earlier and at much lower prices than those currently offered in the marketplace, changes that are likely to reduce industry revenue and that may damage overall incentives to produce new content while, at the same time, curbing only a small share of piracy.

/doi/10.1287/msom.2018.0722," Problem definition : Stockists are the entity in the supply chain who deliver to the millions of small shops that account for over 90% of retail sales in India. The stockist purchases product from the manufacturer, develops retailer interest in carrying the product, solves the logistics problem of delivery to retailers, and manages retail credit and money collection. In return, the stockist is provided assistance by the manufacturer and paid an associated margin that is a percent of the product’s retail price. We observed relatively low distribution margins offered to the stockists in India that was a surprise given infrastructure and financing challenges. We noted that the low margins are enabled by the efficiency in product delivery and demand stimulation induced by the stockist. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of screening contracts offered by manufacturers to stockists. Methodology : We use a principal–agent model structure and model the routing cost, inventory cost, and demand impact of the stockist’s capability. We then use a substitutes or complements relationship between manufacturer assistance and stockist impact to understand the optimal contract structure—i.e., level of assistance and associated retail margin. We describe the economics associated with the stockist, provide data regarding the margins and assistance provided by the manufacturer, and use the model to understand their use in developing an effective supply chain. Results : Our model uses three parameters to show that a manufacture can adjust the level of spatial retailer intensity and thus the impact of the stockist in generating demand, the fraction of high-performing stockists associated with the manufacturer and the nature of the relationship between assistance provided and its impact on the stockist’s performance (i.e., complements or substitutes relationship), to attain superior performance. Academic/practical relevance : We parameterize data from Indian firms in the consumer goods industry to understand the observed assistance provided by the manufacturer to the stockist, and associated margins. We then use our model to understand actions taken by a manufacturer in the Indian market. Managerial implications : Our analysis provides a framework for manufacturers to design screening contracts for stockists who play a vital role in managing the fragmented retail markets in developing countries.

/doi/10.1287/mksc.2014.0853," The potential demand in a new industry evolves over time. Demand is initially low, but advertising by the industry’s early entrants can speed up demand growth. However, there is intrinsic uncertainty of the demand level in each period and uncertainty of the demand evolution path, which can be affected by the underlying economic environment. We construct a dynamic model that features the stochastically and endogenously expanding demand of a new industry, and we investigate the optimal entry and exit behavior of firms as the industry evolves. We find that firms’ incentive to enter early depends critically on the cost that early entrants have to pay in developing the market. When the cost is high and the benefit spills over to potential entrants, firms have an incentive to wait, and the probability of entry can increase with the number of incumbents under certain circumstances. Firms’ entry strategy is also influenced by the transition of economic states. Firms are more likely to enter under a state that shows the prospect of demand taking off soon. We also find that, in the early stage of an industry, higher demand uncertainty can induce faster entry."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2021.4069," Choice-based demand estimation is a fundamental task in retail operations and revenue management, providing necessary input data for inventory control, assortment, and price-optimization models. The task is particularly difficult in operational contexts where product availability varies over time and customers may substitute into the available options. In addition to the classical multinomial logit (MNL) model and extensions (e.g., nested logit, mixed logit, and latent-class MNL), new demand models have been proposed (e.g., the Markov chain model), and others have been recently revisited (e.g., the rank list-based and exponomial models). At the same time, new computational approaches were developed to ease the estimation function (e.g., column-generation and expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms). In this paper, we conduct a systematic, empirical study of different choice-based demand models and estimation algorithms, including both maximum-likelihood and least-squares criteria. Through an exhaustive set of numerical experiments on synthetic, semisynthetic, and real data, we provide comparative statistics of the predictive power and derived revenue performance of an ample collection of choice models and characterize operational environments suitable for different model/estimation implementations. We also provide a survey of all the discrete choice models evaluated and share all our estimation codes and data sets as part of the online appendix.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2021.4014," Automated investment managers, or robo-advisors, have emerged as an alternative to traditional financial advisors. The viability of robo-advisors crucially depends on their ability to offer personalized financial advice. We introduce a novel framework in which a robo-advisor interacts with a client to solve an adaptive mean-variance portfolio optimization problem. The risk-return tradeoff adapts to the client’s risk profile, which depends on idiosyncratic characteristics, market returns, and economic conditions. We show that the optimal investment strategy includes both myopic and intertemporal hedging terms that reflect the dynamic risk profile of the client. We characterize the optimal portfolio personalization via a tradeoff faced by the robo-advisor between receiving information from the client in a timely manner and mitigating behavioral biases in the communicated risk profile. We argue that the optimal portfolio’s Sharpe ratio and return distribution improve if the robo-advisor counters the client’s tendency to reduce market exposure during economic contractions when the market risk-return tradeoff is more favorable.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1128," We examine the role of information-based stock trading in affecting the risk–incentive relation. By incorporating an endogenous informed trading into an optimal incentive contracting model, we analytically show that, apart from reducing incentives, a greater risk increases the level of information-based trading, which consequently enhances executive incentives and offsets the negative risk–incentive relation. We calibrate the model and find that the economic magnitude of this incentive-enhancement effect is significant. Our empirical test using real-world executive compensation data lends strong support to the model prediction. Our results suggest that principals (boards of directors) should consider underlying stock trading characteristics when structuring executive incentives."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2471," We study sourcing in a supply chain with three levels: a manufacturer, tier 1 suppliers, and tier 2 suppliers prone to disruption from, e.g., natural disasters such as earthquakes or floods. The manufacturer may not directly dictate which tier 2 suppliers are used but may influence the sourcing decisions of tier 1 suppliers via contract parameters. The manufacturer’s optimal strategy depends critically on the degree of overlap in the supply chain: if tier 1 suppliers share tier 2 suppliers, resulting in a “diamond-shaped” supply chain, the manufacturer relies less on direct mitigation (procuring excess inventory and multisourcing in tier 1) and more on indirect mitigation (inducing tier 1 suppliers to mitigate disruption risk). We also show that while the manufacturer always prefers less overlap, tier 1 suppliers may prefer a more overlapped supply chain and hence may strategically choose to form a diamond-shaped supply chain. This preference conflict worsens as the manufacturer’s profit margin increases, as disruptions become more severe, and as unreliable tier 2 suppliers become more heterogeneous in their probability of disruption; however, penalty contracts—in which the manufacturer penalizes tier 1 suppliers for a failure to deliver ordered units—alleviate this coordination problem.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2020.3947," We examine the valuation impact of bank-financed mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and the loan contracts used to finance M&A transactions, focusing on the difference between bank-dependent acquirers and other acquirers. We find that bank-financed deals have higher acquirer’s cumulative abnormal returns relative to other cash M&A deals, but this certification effect exists only for bank-dependent acquirers. Despite bank-dependent acquirers being more susceptible to hold-up, banks do not impose higher loan pricing or more stringent nonprice terms on them. After completion of the acquisition, bank-dependent acquirers retain the M&A financing banks for a much larger share of their borrowing needs, suggesting the importance of repeat business for lack of hold-up. Our findings highlight the positive aspects of bank dependence and the importance of implicit contracting for the lack of hold-up in lending markets.

/doi/10.1287/isre.1120.0468," Crowd-funded markets have recently emerged as a novel source of capital for entrepreneurs. As the economic potential of these markets is now being realized, they are beginning to go mainstream, a trend reflected by the explicit attention crowdfunding has received in the American Jobs Act as a potential avenue for economic growth, as well as the recent focus that regulators such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have placed upon it. Although the formulation of regulation and policy surrounding crowd-funded markets is becoming increasingly important, the behavior of crowdfunders, an important aspect that must be considered in this formulation effort, is not yet well understood. A key factor that can influence the behavior of crowd funders is information on prior contribution behavior, including the amount and timing of others' contributions, which is published for general consumption. With that in mind, in this study, we empirically examine social influence in a crowd-funded marketplace for online journalism projects, employing a unique data set that incorporates contribution events and Web traffic statistics for approximately 100 story pitches. This data set allows us to examine both the antecedents and consequences of the contribution process. First, noting that digital journalism is a form of public good, we evaluate the applicability of two competing classes of economic models that explain private contribution toward public goods in the presence of social information: substitution models and reinforcement models. We also propose a new measure that captures both the amount and the timing of others' contribution behavior: contribution frequency (dollars per unit time). We find evidence in support of a substitution model, which suggests a partial crowding-out effect, where contributors may experience a decrease in their marginal utility from making a contribution as it becomes less important to the recipient. Further, we find that the duration of funding and, more importantly, the degree of exposure that a pitch receives over the course of the funding process, are positively associated with readership upon the story's publication. This appears to validate the widely held belief that a key benefit of the crowdfunding model is the potential it offers for awareness and attention-building around causes and ventures. This last aspect is a major contribution of the study, as it demonstrates a clear linkage between marketing effort and the success of crowd-funded projects."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2984," Controlling digital piracy has remained a top priority for manufacturers of information goods, as well as for many governments around the world. Among the many forms taken by digital piracy, we focus on an increasingly common one—namely, online piracy —that is facilitated by torrent sites and cyberlockers who bring together consumers of pirated content and its suppliers. Motivated by recent empirical literature that makes a clear distinction between antipiracy efforts that restrict supply of pirated goods ( supply-side enforcement) and ones that penalize illegal consumption ( demand-side enforcement), we develop a simple economic model and discover some fundamental differences between these two types in terms of their impacts on innovation and welfare. All in all, supply-side enforcement turns out to be the “longer arm”—it has a more desirable economic impact in the long run. Our results have clear implications for manufacturers, consumers, and policy makers. The online supplement is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2984 .

/doi/10.1287/inte.28.1.6," Because of the upcoming deregulation and the advent of high-speed rail networks, European passenger railroads are battling for customers among themselves and with other means of transportation. To maintain a competitive advantage, they rely on the scheduling process as a key factor in winning market share. Societé Nationale des Chemins de Fer Français (SNCF), in partnership with SABRE Technology Solutions, has developed RailPlus, a strategic schedule planning system, and RailCap, a tactical capacity-adjustment system, to meet the new challenges of the rail business. The heart of these systems is a set of advanced operations research models that enable analysts to take a global approach to decision making. The two systems combined provide 110 million francs in incremental revenue per year and substantially reduce operating costs. In addition, the two systems have become the foundation for the reorganization of SNCF/TGV."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.1120.0767," Do strong demographic faultlines breed opinion polarization in work teams? We integrate two theories that have been used to explain faultline effects. The first, the approach of Lau and Murnighan [Lau DC, Murnighan JK (1998) Demographic diversity and faultlines: The compositional dynamics of organizational groups. Acad. Management Rev. 23(2):325–340], suggests that in teams with strong faultlines the mechanisms of homophilous selection of interaction partners and persuasive influence cause subgroup polarization, defined as the split of the team into subgroups holding opposing opinions. The second, from sociological and anthropological traditions, emphasizes that crisscrossing actors bridge faultlines because they share demographic attributes with several subgroups. Demographically crisscrossing actors help to prevent polarization in social groups. We argue that Lau and Murnighan’s theory implicitly factors in the effects of crisscrossing actors. However, we show that the authors overlooked crucial implications of their theory because they did not consider crisscrossing actors explicitly. Most importantly, we demonstrate that demographic crisscrossing implies that even teams with strong faultlines will overcome polarization in the long run, although they might suffer from it in the short term. We develop and analyze a formal computational model of the opinion and network dynamics in work teams to show the consistency of our reasoning with Lau and Murnighans’ theory. The model also revealed another counterintuitive effect: strong faultlines lead to structures of interaction that make teams with strong faultlines faster in arriving at a stable consensus than teams with weak faultlines."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.20.4.629," The 1960's saw the introduction of simulation techniques into the area of urban and regional planning. The present paper describes a large-scale urban simulation effort currently underway in Vancouver, British Columbia. The project differs from similar work in a number of ways. Most notably, the current effort stresses the process of model-building, including the widespread public use and discussion of the work and its limitations. The paper emphasizes this process orientation, and illustrates the content of the models with a detailed description of the economic submodel. This submodel combines input-output analysis with a simulation model of final demands to yield consistent economic forecasts for the region. Capsule summaries of the other submodels are also presented. The paper concludes with a focus on questions of use and misuse of simulation models."
/doi/10.1287/ijoc.2013.0556," The United States pediatric vaccine manufacturing market is analyzed using a static Bertrand oligopoly pricing model that characterizes oligopolistic interactions between asymmetric firms in a homogeneous multiple product market. Firms satisfy demand by appropriately pricing and selling its given set of bundles, where each bundle contains one or more products. In analyzing the pediatric vaccine market, a bundle is a vaccine, where each vaccine contains one or more immunogenic antigens. Consumers seek to purchase at least one of each antigen at an overall minimum cost. Demand is captured by defining a weighted set covering optimization problem, with the weights (prices) controlled by firms engaged in Bertrand competition. A repeated game version of the model enables multiple interactions between firms, allowing examination of tacit collusion. An iterative improvement algorithm is defined that constructs a pure strategy Nash equilibrium (some in the limiting sense) for the static game. Sufficient conditions for the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria are provided, indicating that this class of games always yields at least one pure strategy equilibrium. Practical results of the pediatric vaccine market analysis follow from the difference in the repeated game equilibrium prices between two combination vaccines, Pediarix ® and Pentacel ® . Assuming the manufacturers of these vaccines agree to share the market equally with respect to volume, the equilibrium prices from the repeated game indicate a price difference of $0.86, whereas the difference in price between Pediarix ® and Pentacel ® for contract prices ending March 31, 2010 was $2.74. Interestingly, the subsequent public sector vaccine price list (contract prices ending March 31, 2011) shows a price difference of $0.95, with the price of Pentacel ® actually reduced from the previous year—an unusual occurrence. The results presented in this paper suggest that a smaller price difference between these two important combination vaccines is appropriate, which is what occurred. In general, such results could serve to inform both manufacturers and purchasers on the appropriate pricing of combination vaccines, given the existence of a reasonable set of collusive agreements."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.1050.0177," The motion picture industry has provided a fruitful research domain for scholars in marketing and other disciplines. The industry has high economic importance and is appealing to researchers because it offers both rich data that cover the entire product lifecycle for many new products and because it provides many unsolved “puzzles.” Although the amount of scholarly research in this area is rapidly growing, its impact on practice has not been as significant as in other industries (e.g., consumer packaged goods). In this article, we discuss critical practical issues for the motion picture industry, review existing knowledge on those issues, and outline promising research directions. Our review is organized around the three key stages in the value chain for theatrical motion pictures: production, distribution, and exhibition. Focusing on what we believe are critical managerial issues, we propose various conjectures—framed either as research challenges or specific research hypotheses—related to each stage in the value chain and often involved in understanding consumer movie-going behavior."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.11.4.B59," Since the end of World War II, the single most outstanding development in the world of business has been the economic renaissance of the Free World. From the devastation and dislocation left by 6 years of war, the Western business community has rebuilt and redirected itself in two decades of unparalleled growth and prosperity. The postwar prophets of gloom, who prognosticated postwar collapse and stagnation as in the Great Depression of the 1930s have long since been routed. And a serious economic setback appears now to be less likely than ever. Certainly the business manager of today can look back proudly on a job well done. Clearly this period has been a triumph for the free enterprise system and the traditional concepts and techniques of management. Nevertheless, the business managers of today cannot rest on these accomplishments. For change is in the air, and the traditional concepts of management cannot fully meet the challenge that it brings. These established concepts, of course, themselves originally evolved as new responses to new business challenges. And it is worth remembering that many of the familiar management techniques of today were not traditional concepts 20 years ago. The manager of 1946 would be very uncomfortable and unsure of himself in the sophisticated management world of today. New tools and techniques of management are taken for granted by today's manager. And the search for newer and better techniques presses on."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2019.0790," Problem definition : A key question in socially responsible supply networks is as follows: When firms audit some, but not all, of their respective suppliers, how do the degree centralities of the suppliers (i.e., the number of firms to which they supply) affect their auditing priority from the viewpoint of the firms? To investigate, we consider an assembly network consisting of two firms and three suppliers; each firm has one independent supplier that uniquely supplies to that firm and one common supplier that supplies to both. Academic/practical relevance : Most supply networks are characterized by firms that source from multiple suppliers and suppliers that serve multiple firms, thus resulting in suppliers who differ in their degree centrality. In such networks, any negative publicity from suppliers’ noncompliance with socially responsible practices—for example, employment of child labor, unsafe working conditions, and excessive pollution—can significantly damage the reputation of the buying firms. To mitigate this impact, firms preemptively audit suppliers although resource and time considerations typically restrict the number of suppliers a firm can audit. Consequently, it becomes important to understand the impact of the degree centralities of the suppliers on the priority with which firms audit them. Methodology : Game-theoretic analysis. Results : Downstream competition between the firms drives them away from auditing the supplier with higher centrality, that is, the common supplier, in equilibrium, despite the fact that auditing this supplier is better for the aggregate profit of the firms. We show that this inefficiency is corrected when the firms cooperate (via a stable coalition) to jointly audit the suppliers and share the auditing cost in a fair manner. We also identify conditions under which joint auditing improves social welfare. Managerial implications : We have two main messages: (i) individual incentives can lead firms to deprioritize the auditing of structurally important suppliers, which is inefficient; (ii) the practice of joint auditing can correct this inefficiency."
