/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0765," Although previous scholars have examined the value of virtual communities to customers, in this study we investigate the role of a firm's efforts in cultivating trust and harvesting value for themselves via the virtual communities that they sponsor. We hypothesize that the perceptions of a firm's efforts to provide quality content, to foster member embeddedness, and to encourage interaction foster favorable customer beliefs about and trust in a virtual community sponsor. Further, we hypothesize that trust motivates customers to behave relationally toward the sponsoring firm by sharing information with, coproducing new products with, and granting loyalty to, the sponsoring firm. Data from 663 customers are analyzed using structural equation modeling techniques. We find that efforts to provide quality content and foster member embeddedness have positive effects on customer beliefs about the sponsor. In fact, fostering member embeddedness has a stronger explanatory effect on customer beliefs than does providing quality content. However, despite the fact that previous studies show that customers value interaction in virtual communities, our findings suggest that firms must do more than encourage interaction among their community members if they hope to create value from their virtual communities."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2015.0970," In the early to mid-1990s, technology alliances suddenly surged to unprecedented levels—roughly 300% growth per year from 1990 to 1995—and then declined just as precipitously. This massive increase in alliance activity caused the crystallization of a giant component in the global technology network that connected a large portion of the world’s firms, government labs, universities, and other organizations. However, when alliance activity declined, the component disintegrated. What caused this spike in alliance activity? And did this large-but-transient change in collaboration activity leave any enduring effect? The data here suggest that a major technology shock may have provoked this alliance surge. A technology shock may simultaneously unleash significant innovation opportunities while creating great uncertainty in the economic environment. Though it is well known that firms often use alliances both to respond to uncertainty and facilitate innovation, little is known about how technology shocks affect the collaboration behavior of firms and how these two factors separately influence innovation outcomes. I integrate an inductive study of collaboration activity and a technology shock with existing research on economics, alliances, and networks to build a set of arguments about how technology shocks will influence alliance behavior, how changes in alliance behavior will influence the global technology collaboration network, and about how each of these changes is likely to influence the innovative outcomes of firms. I then explore the separate and joint effects of the technology shock and collaboration activity on innovation using a large sample panel study of patenting by North American firms."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.18.3.396," The usefulness of a technology product for an end-user often depends on the availability of complementary software products and services. Computers require software, cameras require film, and DVD players require movie programming in order for customers to value the whole product. This phenomenon, where the demand for hardware products is mediated by the supply of complementary software products, is called an indirect network externality. Indirect network externalities create a two-way contingency between the demand for the hardware product and the supply of software products, and result in a strategic interdependence between the actions of hardware manufacturers and the actions of software providers. Indirect network externalities are gaining economic significance in technology markets, because hardware and software are typically provided by independent firms, and both sets of firms have an incentive to free-ride on each others' demand creation efforts. Despite the ubiquity of this phenomenon, it has largely been ignored in the marketing science literature. We present a conceptual and operational model for the evolution of markets with indirect network externalities. The key feature of our framework is to model the market-mediated dependence between the actions of hardware manufacturers and software complementors, created by the direct dependence of consumer demand for the whole product on the actions of manufacturers as well as complementors. In addition, we incorporate marketing-mix effects on consumer response, as well as heterogeneity in consumer preferences for hardware and software attributes. We model consumer response using a latent-class choice model. To estimate the complementor response functions, we use a modified Delphi technique that allows us to convert qualitative response data into quantitative response functions. We integrate the consumer and complementor response models to create a simulation model that generates forecasts of market shares and sales volumes for competing technologies, as a function of marketing-mix effects and exogenously specified regulatory scenarios. The modeling framework is of interest to new product modelers interested in creating empirical models and decision-support systems for forecasting demand in technology markets characterized by indirect network externalities. The decision-support aspects of the modeling framework should appeal to managers interested in understanding and quantifying the complex interplay between hardware manufacturers and software complementors in the evolution of markets with indirect network externalities. We present an application of the modeling framework to the U.S. digital television industry, and use the framework to characterize the competition among analog and digital TV technologies. Our results suggest that complementor actions play an important role in the acceptance of digital TV technologies in general, and high definition television (HDTV) in particular. We find that forecasts that ignore the influence of indirect network externalities would be seriously biased in favor of HDTV. We illustrate how the modeling framework can be used to identify and profile customer segments in the digital TV market based on their utility for hardware-related features as well as programming-related features. We also illustrate the decision-support capabilities of the modeling framework by evaluating the sensitivity of the forecasts to varying marketing, regulatory, and complementor response scenarios. We derive implications for marketing and public affairs policies of the hardware manufacturers. The developments in the digital TV industry generally support our finding that HDTV will be a niche product, and will diffuse slower than originally expected due in part to the lack of programming. The delays in the introduction of digital TV to the marketplace also suggest that most forecasts for infrastructure-intensive technologies like digital TV may be too optimistic simply because they underestimate the delays in agreeing upon technology standards and resolving regulatory debates."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2008," We model a new product market opportunity as an option and ask whether it is best exploited by a large incumbent firm (integration) or by a small separate firm (nonintegration). Starting from a standard framework, in which value-maximizing investment and financing decisions are jointly determined, we show that integration protects assets in place value, whereas nonintegration protects option value and maximizes financial flexibility. We show that increases in standard measures of cash flow risk predict exploitation of new opportunities by specialized firms, whereas increases in product market competition (e.g., the risk of competitive preemption) predict exploitation by incumbents. We also show that alliances organized as licensing agreements or revenue-sharing contracts sometimes better balance the sources of value and thus may dominate more traditional forms of organization. These organizational equilibria arise from the dynamic interaction of the new opportunity’s option-like features with realistic competitive forces. This paper was accepted by Brad Barber, finance."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3548," We use a social learning perspective to extend our understanding of information technology (IT) investment and return. Specifically, we investigate social learning in the context of interlocks between corporate boards, which allow firms to share knowledge and experiences with respect to their IT investments. Using a large data set of firm-years from 2001–2008, we find (a) a positive relationship exists between a focal firm’s IT investment and that of its interlocked firms; (b) this positive relationship is amplified by the interlocked firms’ IT capability but only if the focal firm has an active board, which devotes time to allow sufficient communication among directors; and (c) the component of the focal firm’s IT investment that is attributable to board interlock influence is positively related to the firm’s performance but only if the firm has an active board. Collectively, these findings support our central thesis: social learning through board interlocks can play a significant role in influencing a firm’s IT investments and enhancing their payoff. That said, attaining such benefits requires boards to incorporate those firms with high IT management capability and to strengthen board activity so interlocked members can substantively share their knowledge and experiences with IT investments.

/doi/10.1287/isre.2020.0950," Due to digitization, new mechanisms have emerged for achieving organizational ambidexterity, defined as the ability to pursue both efficiency and flexibility while balancing exploitation and exploration. This study investigates the role of digitization in achieving organizational structural ambidexterity by undertaking both exploitation and exploration simultaneously. Given the complex interdependencies between digitization and multiple intrafirm and interfirm factors in practice, this study adopts a configurational theory perspective. We posit that ambidexterity is better explained as an outcome of aligning digitization with several intrafirm and interfirm factors, rather than of any individual factors in isolation. We empirically derive configurations for achieving ambidexterity by applying fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to 1,325 Canadian firms that invested in new information technology system implementation. The results reveal the mechanisms in which digitization plays a multifaceted role in achieving ambidexterity. Notably, the mechanisms differ among intrafirm-oriented configurations and interfirm strategic alliance configurations, and among large firms and small firms. In the intrafirm solution, digitization and centralization are essential for achieving ambidexterity, with other factors being peripheral; however, in the interfirm solution, digitization plays a peripheral, and even a counterproductive role, in achieving ambidexterity. Particularly, intrafirm collaboration is a necessary condition in both the intrafirm and interfirm solutions for achieving ambidexterity. Interestingly, the results also suggest that small firms seeking ambidexterity require a high level of digitization only while pursuing an intrafirm (but not for an interfirm) solution, whereas large firms require a high level of digitization for both intrafirm and interfirm solutions. New insights and implications for theory and practice for achieving organizational ambidexterity with digitization are discussed."
/doi/10.1287/trsc.1030.0037," Bounds and approximate formulae are developed for the average optimum distance of the transportation linear programming (TLP) problem with homogeneously, but randomly distributed points and demands in a region of arbitrary shape. It is shown that if the region size grows with a fixed density of points, then the cost per item is bounded from above in 3 + dimensions (3 + -D), but not in 1-D and 2-D. Lower bounds are also developed, based on a mild monotonicity conjecture. Computer simulations confirm the conjecture and yield approximate formulae. These formulae turn out to have the same functional form as the upper bounds. Curiously, the monotonicity conjecture implies that the cost per item does not depend on zone shape asymptotically, as problem size increases, for 2 + -D problems but it does in 1-D. Therefore, the 2-D case can be viewed as a transition case that shares some of the properties of 1-D (unbounded cost) and some of the properties of 3-D (shape independence). The results are then extended to more general network models with subadditive link costs. It is found that if the cost functions have economies of scale, then the cost per item is bounded in 2-D. This explains the prevalence of the “last mile” effect in many logistics applications. The paper also discusses how the results were used to estimate costs under uncertainty for a vehicle repositioning problem."
/doi/10.1287/ijoc.2016.0707," For a cost-sharing cooperative game with an empty core, we study the problem of calculating a near-optimal cost allocation that satisfies coalitional stability constraints and maximizes the total cost allocated to all players. One application of such a problem is finding the minimum level of subsidy required to stabilize the grand coalition. To obtain solutions, we propose a new generic framework based on Lagrangian relaxation, which has several advantages over existing work that exclusively relies on linear programming (LP) relaxation techniques. Our approach can generate better cost allocations than LP-based algorithms, and is also applicable to a broader range of problems. To illustrate the efficiency and performance of the Lagrangian relaxation framework, we investigate two different facility location games. The results demonstrate that our new approach can find better cost allocations than the LP-based algorithm, or provide alternative optimal cost allocations for cases that the LP-based algorithm can also solve to optimality."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2020.1275," We empirically investigate how writers’ output is affected by copyright piracy using data from a Chinese digital publishing platform. We identify two measurements of writers’ output—creative productivity and customer care—which are also affected by readers’ feedback through purchasing, tipping, and commenting. We take advantage of an exogenous event—the termination of a free personal storage service and search function by a leading Chinese cloud storage provider in June 2016—to causally identify the effects of the resulting reduced copyright piracy on writers’ efforts. Using a difference-in-differences modeling approach, we compare the changes in average writer behavior before and after the event across two groups of writers: (1) writers who have profit-sharing contracts with the platform and (2) those who do not. We find that after the termination, contracted writers increased their creative productivity efforts in terms of quantity without sacrificing quality but reduced their customer care efforts. However, these effects are absent for noncontracted writers. Our study is among the first to provide empirical support for the positive effect of digital intellectual property rights infringement reduction on creative productivity."
/doi/10.1287/opre.2016.1510," Sustainable and efficient management of a distribution system requires coordination between transportation planning and inventory control decisions. In this context, we consider a one warehouse multi-retailer inventory system with a time-based shipment consolidation policy at the warehouse. This means that there are fixed costs associated with each shipment, and retailer orders are consolidated and shipped periodically to groups of retailers sharing the same delivery routes. Customer demand is compound Poisson distributed and unsatisfied demand at each stock point is backordered and allocated on a first-come first-served basis. The system is centralized and inventory levels are reviewed continuously. The warehouse has access to real-time inventory information from the retailers, and uses a ( R , nQ ) policy to replenish from an outside supplier/manufacturer. We derive the exact probability distributions for the inventory levels at the retailers, and use these to obtain exact expressions for the system’s expected shipment, holding and backorder costs, its average inventory levels, and fill rates. Based on the analytical properties of the objective function, we construct an optimization procedure by deriving bounds on the optimal reorder levels and shipment intervals both for single-item and multi-item systems."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2021.1303," Despite increasing use of social media, little is known about user competition and its effect on social platforms. In this research, we propose a model where social media users supply content in return for user attention. Using Twitter data on soccer players from the National Women’s Soccer League, we estimate a demand model where users decide how to allocate their attention among players, based on their content posted on social media and their performance on the soccer field. We consider the amount of tweets mentioning a player’s account as a measure for the level of attention captured by the player. On the supply side, players decide the amount of social media content posted on the platform. We show that the attention substitution between players depends on their posting activity and soccer performance but also on personal characteristics, such as physical attractiveness and team affiliation. Our analysis suggests that the competitive pressure to capture user attention is responsible for about one out of three tweets posted by players. This additional content benefits the social network, increasing by 7% the users’ activity on the platform. We also quantify the effect on user activity of a revenue-sharing model in which the platform rewards players for posting tweets."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2017.1121," Prior research has established a relation between intrafirm mobility and innovation outcomes at distributed organizations. The literature has also uniformly agreed on the mechanism underlying this relationship: the sharing of tacit knowledge and recombination of ideas that occurs because of intrafirm mobility. But a second mechanism may also be at work: intrafirm mobility might help distant employees secure access to resources for their innovative projects. Using unique data on travel, employment, and patenting for 1,315 inventors at the Indian research and development (R&D) center of a Fortune 50 multinational, I find that intrafirm mobility in the form of short-duration business trips from a distant R&D location to headquarters is positively related to higher subsequent patenting at the individual level. I also find mobility immediately prior to meetings at which R&D funds are most likely to be disbursed to be related to higher subsequent patenting. This study sheds new light on how intrafirm mobility and possible face-to-face interactions with those who allocate resources might affect innovation outcomes and the matching of resources to individuals within a distributed organization.

/doi/10.1287/opre.1080.0527," Annual influenza outbreaks incur great expenses in both human and monetary terms, and billions of dollars are being allocated for influenza pandemic preparedness in an attempt to avert even greater potential losses. Vaccination is a primary weapon for fighting influenza outbreaks. The influenza vaccine supply chain has characteristics that resemble the newsvendor problem but possesses several characteristics that distinguish it from many other supply chains. Differences include a nonlinear value of sales (caused by the nonlinear health benefits of vaccination that are due to infection dynamics) and vaccine production yield issues. We show that production risks, taken currently by the vaccine manufacturer, lead to an insufficient supply of vaccine. Several supply contracts that coordinate buyer (governmental public health service) and supplier (vaccine manufacturer) incentives in many other industrial supply chains cannot fully coordinate the influenza vaccine supply chain. We design a variant of the cost-sharing contract and show that it provides incentives to both parties so that the supply chain achieves global optimization and hence improves the supply of vaccines."
/doi/10.1287/isre.1080.0205," Past research has studied how the selection and use of control portfolios in software projects is based on environmental and task characteristics. However, little research has examined the consequences of control mode choices on project performance. This paper reports on a study that addresses this issue in the context of outsourced software projects. In addition, we propose that boundary-spanning activities between the vendor and the client enable knowledge sharing across organizational and knowledge domain boundaries. This is expected to lead to facilitation of control through specific incentives and performance norms that are suited to client needs as well as the vendor context. Therefore, we argue that boundary spanning between the vendor and client moderates the relationship between formal controls instituted by the vendor on the development team and project performance. We also hypothesize the effect of collaboration as a clan control on project performance. We examine project performance in terms of software quality and project efficiency. The research model is empirically tested in the Indian software industry setting on a sample of 96 projects. The results suggest that formal and informal control modes have a significant impact on software project outcomes, but need to be finely tuned and directed toward appropriate objectives. In addition, boundary-spanning activities significantly improve the effectiveness of formal controls. Finally, we find that collaborative culture has provided mixed benefits by enhancing quality but reducing efficiency."
/doi/10.1287/deca.2015.0326," This article suggests backer financing mechanisms that encourage an entrepreneur to launch a start-up that has unacceptable risk although positive expected payout. It uses decision analysis and certainty equivalents to compare these mechanisms from both the entrepreneur’s and the backer’s points of view. Backers may be local and national governments interested in technology, job creation, and growing the tax base; foundations; charities; nongovernmental organizations; and even corporations or individuals interested in a new product or technology. Alternative mechanisms include (a) the equity participation model predominant in start-up financing, (b) outright incentive gifts, (c) insurance against downside loss, and two new ideas: (d) swap hedge and (e) revenue contract. We develop risk analysis models of the alternative mechanisms, from which we calculate the comparative risk-adjusted attractiveness of each mechanism to the entrepreneur for a similar level of expected cost to the backer. The best alternatives, two highly efficient new ideas, eliminate moral hazard and leave ownership and control in the hands of the entrepreneur. And in the revenue contract, the backer may be additionally rewarded with money back sooner. Teachers may use the modeling and analysis to demonstrate comparative analysis of hedging versus insurance and fixed versus floating contracts, as well as risk sharing."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2015.0607," Mandatory security standards that force firms to establish minimum levels of security controls are enforced in many domains, including information security. The information security domain is characterized by multiple intertwined security controls, not all of which can be regulated by standards, but compliance with existing security standards is often used by firms to deflect liability if a security breach occurs. We analyze a stylized setting where a firm has two security controls that are linked in either a serial or a parallel configuration. One control is directly regulated by a security standard, whereas the other one is not. We show that a higher security standard does not necessarily lead to a higher firm security. Furthermore, the conditions under which a higher standard hurts the firm security are sharply different in the two—serial and parallel—configurations. If standard compliance leads to reduced liability for a firm following a breach, such liability reduction in turn weakens the tie between the standard and firm security. Under a setting in which the firm meets the optimal standard set by a policy maker, both firm security and social welfare are higher when the damage to the firm following a breach takes a higher share of the total damage to social welfare, and also when the firm takes a larger share of liability."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0919," Voluntary standard-setting organizations (SSOs) are a common feature of systems industries, where firms supply interoperable components for a shared technology platform. These institutions promote coordinated innovation by providing a forum for collective decision making and a potential solution to the problem of fragmented and overlapping intellectual property rights. This paper examines the economic and technological significance of SSOs by analyzing the flow of citations to a sample of U.S. patents disclosed during the standard-setting process. Our main results show that the age distribution of SSO patent citations is shifted toward later years (relative to an average patent) and that citations increase substantially following standardization. These results suggest that SSOs identify promising technologies and influence their subsequent adoption."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2019.1165," Governments often regulate marketing activities to ensure marketers do not misinform consumers and obtain “unfair” advantages. Yet, ample research finds such regulations may be ineffective since marketers are able to circumvent them. We examine if umbrella branding, a marketing strategy of multiple products sharing a common brand, can be used to circumvent marketing regulations on a given product. Specifically, in the asset management industry, we examine if hedge funds, faced with a comprehensive marketing ban, benefited from the advertising by their umbrella brand mutual fund affiliates and, if so, whether the hedge funds exploited this effect. We find that higher advertising by mutual fund affiliates leads to a significant increase in sales of umbrella brand hedge funds and that hedge funds’ circumstances in a trailing period impact the likelihood of advertising by their umbrella brand mutual fund affiliates. More importantly, using the 2012 JOBS Act that removed hedge funds’ marketing restrictions as a natural experiment, we find that hedge funds’ trailing circumstances had significantly less impact on umbrella branded mutual fund advertising after the passage of the JOBS Act. These findings are consistent with hedge funds using umbrella branding to circumvent the marketing ban."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.19.2.163.11806," Manufacturers and distributors in marketing channels commonly establish prices, margins, and other trade terms through negotiations. These negotiations have significant impact on channel members' profit streams over the duration of the business relationship. We consider a situation where a manufacturer and an exclusive, independent distributor are negotiating the transfer (wholesale) price of a new product. The transfer price should lie between the manufacturer's production cost and the maximum resale price that the distributor can charge end consumers (consumers' reservation price). We assume that the negotiations occur in an incomplete and asymmetric information environment such that the manufacturer is uncertain about the consumers' reservation price, whereas the distributor knows it precisely because of proximity to the consumer. The negotiation is time-sensitive because of the threat of potential competitive entry. Both parties have identical opportunity costs of delay in reaching agreement. In this incomplete and asymmetric information environment, the negotiators must learn before they can reach agreement. However, each negotiator has an incentive to convince the other that the available surplus is smaller than it really is. Hence, a high (low) offer (counteroffer) has little credibility without opportunity costs of delay. For any given manufacturer offer, a distributor facing a low consumer reservation price has a small available surplus and therefore more incentive to delay agreement than if the price is high. Willingness to delay agreement and incur delay costs lends credibility to the price signal in an offer (counteroffer), providing a means for communicating credibly and facilitating agreement. Thus, with incomplete, asymmetric information and opportunity costs of delay, a signaling formulation with alternating offers and counteroffers captures key strategic characteristics of marketing channel negotiations. We adapt a game-theoretic model (Grossman and Perry 1986a, 1986b) to predict bargaining behavior and outcomes in this channel negotiation scenario. We derive both point predictions and directional implications from this sequential equilibrium (SE) bargaining model regarding how manufacturer uncertainty about distributor value (consumers' reservation price), opportunity cost of delay, and the actual reservation price (total surplus) should influence bargaining outcomes. The predictions are tested in two experiments. The point predictions serve as benchmarks against which we evaluate the observed bargaining outcomes, as we focus on testing the model's directional implications. We also explore the underlying bargaining process to assess the extent to which subjects conform to the SE signaling rationale in optimizing channel profits. Both experiments show that the point predictions of the SE model fall considerably short in describing bargaining behavior and outcomes. The players bargained suboptimally, took longer to agree, and could not extract the total available surplus. Nevertheless, the data are consistent with several directional predictions of the SE model. There is consistent support for the predicted directional effects of manufacturer uncertainty and consumer reservation prices. As expected, high uncertainty impeded efficient negotiation, eliciting high first offers from manufacturers and increasing bargaining duration. Also, higher reservation prices (higher surplus) lowered bargaining duration, increased bargaining efficiency, and raised profits for both parties. However, support for the predicted directional effects of opportunity cost of delay is mixed. Higher delay costs produced quicker agreements, but distributors did not benefit from their informational advantage. Although the directional results suggest that the SE model is a good representation of bargaining behavior, a closer analysis shows that the bargaining process data did not correspond to the specific signaling rationale of the SE model. Rather, these data suggest that the bargainers created simplified representations of the price negotiation and used heuristics to develop their offers and counteroffers. We observe two systematic patterns of deviations from the SE model. Some manufacturers may have used the counteroffer levels to infer the distributors' competitive stance and factored this into their responses. Thus, even though the distributor counteroffers carried signals of the consumer reservation price, the manufacturers delayed agreement because they either did not recognize the signal or thought it was unreliable. In other cases, the data are consistent with a simple, nonstrategic model (EMP) in which the manufacturer and the distributor divide the monetary payoff (surplus) equally. The results show that the effectiveness of signaling mechanisms depends not only on the economic characteristics of the bargaining situation, but also on shared individual and social contexts that influence how signals are transmitted and interpreted."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2019.0815," Problem definition : Unoccupied waiting feels longer than it actually is. Service providers operationalize this psychological principle by offering entertainment options in waiting areas. A service cluster with a common space provides firms with an opportunity to cooperate in the investment for providing entertainment options while competing on other service dimensions. Academic/practical relevance : Our paper contributes to the literature by being the first to examine co-opetition in a service setting, in addition to developing a novel model of waiting-area entertainment. It also sheds new light on the emerging practice of service clusters and small-footprint retailing. Methodology : Using a queueing theoretic approach, we develop a parsimonious model of co-opetition in a service cluster with a common space. Results : By comparing the case of co-opetition with two benchmarks (monopoly and duopoly competition), we demonstrate that a service provider that would otherwise be a local monopolist can achieve higher profitability by joining a service cluster and engaging in co-opetition. Achieving such benefits, however, requires a cost-allocation scheme that properly addresses an efficiency-fairness tradeoff—the pursuit of fairness may backfire and lead to even lower profitability than under pure competition. Managerial implications : We show that as much as co-opetition facilitates resource sharing in a service cluster, it heightens price competition. Furthermore, as the intensity of price competition increases, surprisingly, service providers may opt to charge higher service fees, albeit while providing a higher entertainment level."

/doi/10.1287/opre.2016.1502," We model the influence of sharing large exogeneous losses to the reinsurance market by a bipartite graph. Using Pareto-tailed claims and multivariate regular variation we obtain asymptotic results for the value-at-risk and the conditional tail expectation. We show that the dependence on the network structure plays a fundamental role in their asymptotic behaviour. As is well known in a nonnetwork setting, if the Pareto exponent is larger than 1, then for the individual agent (reinsurance company) diversification is beneficial, whereas when it is less than 1, concentration on a few objects is the better strategy. An additional aspect of this paper is the amount of uninsured losses that are covered by society. In our setting of networks of agents, diversification is never detrimental to the amount of uninsured losses. If the Pareto-tailed claims have finite mean, diversification is never detrimental, to society or individual agents. By contrast, if the Pareto-tailed claims have infinite mean, a conflicting situation may arise between the incentives of individual agents and the interest of some regulator to keep the risk for society small. We explain the influence of the network structure on diversification effects in different network scenarios."
/doi/10.1287/isre.1070.0113," A variety of information technology (IT) artifacts, such as those supporting reputation management and digital archives of past interactions, are commonly deployed to support online communities. Despite their ubiquity, theoretical and empirical research investigating the impact of such IT-based features on online community communication and interaction is limited. Drawing on the social psychology literature, we describe an identity-based view to understand how the use of IT-based features in online communities is associated with online knowledge contribution. Specifically, the use of four categories of IT artifacts—those supporting virtual co-presence, persistent labeling, self-presentation, and deep profiling—is proposed to enhance perceived identity verification, which thereafter promotes satisfaction and knowledge contribution. To test the theoretical model, we surveyed more than 650 members of two online communities. In addition to the positive effects of community IT artifacts on perceived identity verification, we also find that perceived identity verification is strongly linked to member satisfaction and knowledge contribution. This paper offers a new perspective on the mechanisms through which IT features facilitate computer-mediated knowledge sharing, and it yields important implications for the design of the supporting IT infrastructure."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2020.3833," Antitrust regulations are meant to promote fair competition in the market, but balancing administrative and legal costs with enforcement can be difficult when multilayered supply chains are involved. The canonical example of this challenge is the landmark Illinois Brick ruling, which limits antitrust damages to only the direct purchasers of a product; for instance, consumers can file antitrust claims against colluding retailers but not against colluding manufacturers—only retailers can file claims against manufacturers. This controversial ruling was meant to reduce legal costs, but it can clearly lead to missed enforcement opportunities. In this paper, we demonstrate how the Illinois Brick ruling interacts with contracts adopted in the supply chain, and we show that otherwise equivalent supply chain arrangements can have markedly different effects. In particular, we find that wholesale price, minimum order quantity, revenue sharing, and quantity discount contracts lead retailers to take legal action against manufacturers in the event of collusive behavior. However, the wholesale price plus fixed fee contract structure (also known as a two-part tariff or slotting fee contract) facilitates collusion among the manufacturers with retailers compensated by the fixed fee and not filing the antitrust litigation. We further demonstrate that collusion is more likely under high demand uncertainty and high competition at the retail level but is less likely under high competition at the manufacturer level. Our paper helps public enforcers identify market conditions conducive to antitrust violations. This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1922," We propose an intergroup competition scheme (ICS) to theoretically solve free riding in team production and provide experimental evidence from a voluntary contribution mechanism public goods game. The ICS includes an internal transfer payment from the lowest to highest contributing team proportional to the difference in group contributions. The ICS requires minimal information, makes the efficient contribution a dominant strategy, and is budget balanced. These features make the ICS ideally suited to solve the moral hazard problem in team production. Our experiment demonstrates that the ICS raises contributions to almost reach optimality with the appropriate parameters. We also show experimentally that the success of the ICS can be primarily attributed to the effect of higher returns and to the introduction of competition, and it is not due to the introduction of potential losses or information regarding other groups.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1293," The academic and practitioner literature justifies firms' use of product costs in product pricing and capacity planning decisions as heuristics to address an otherwise intractable problem. However, product costs are the output of a cost reporting system, which itself is the outcome of heuristic design choices. In particular, because of informational limitations, when designing cost systems firms use simple rules of thumb to group resources into cost pools and to select drivers used to allocate the pooled costs to products. Using simulations, we examine how popular choices in costing system design influence the error in reported costs. Taking information needs into account, we offer alternative ways to translate the vague guidance in the literature to implementable methods. Specifically, we compare size-based rules for forming cost pools with more informationally demanding correlation-based rules and develop a blended method that performs well in terms of accuracy. In addition, our analysis suggests that significant gains can be made from using a composite driver rather than selecting a driver based on the consumption pattern for the largest resource only, especially when combined with correlation-based rules to group resources. We vary properties of the underlying cost structure (such as the skewness in resource costs, the traceability of resources to products, the sharing of resources across products, and the variance in resource consumption patterns) to address the generalizability of our findings and to show when different heuristics might be preferred.

/doi/10.1287/deca.2019.0407," Over-the-top (OTT) service refers to content included in basic telecommunications subscriptions without the additional features provided by telecom operators. The booming OTT business has had a huge impact on traditional telecommunications businesses such as voice and short message services, and the sense of crisis among telecommunications operators shows that the channeling trend has become more and more obvious. Faced with competition on the distribution of interests between channels and contents, telecommunications operators and OTT service providers are engaged in a fierce competition and cooperation game. To explore this competition relationship, this paper first establishes an evolutionary model, discussing the competition and cooperation behaviors of telecommunications operators and OTT service providers, and then conducts research on the degree of the effects of cooperation in terms of the combination of strategic factors, including cooperation cost sharing, the benefits distribution mechanism, research and development benefits, spillover effect, and network externality. Additionally, a replicator dynamic system is developed to study the influence of related strategic factors on evolutionary equilibrium. Finally, to verify the theoretical results, a simulation experiment is conducted to further clarify the meaning of the model and obtain meaningful results. The evolutionary game model and method provided in this paper are expected to help both parties make better decisions for future operating strategies."
/doi/10.1287/opre.2019.1841," We study an online display advertising planning problem in which advertisers’ demands for ad exposures (impressions) of various types compete for slices of shared resources, and advertisers prefer to receive impressions that are evenly spread across the audience segments they target. We use the Gini coefficient measure and formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the spreading of impressions across targeted audience segments, while limiting demand shortfalls. First, we show how Gini-based metrics can be used to measure spreading that publishers of online advertising care about and how Lorenz curves can be used to visualize Gini-based spread so that managers can effectively monitor the performance of a publisher’s ad delivery system. Second, we adapt an existing ad planning model to measure Gini-based spread across audience segments and compare and contrast our model to this baseline with respect to key properties and the structure of the solutions they produce. Third, we introduce a novel optimization-based decomposition scheme that efficiently solves our instances of the Gini-based problem up to 60 times faster than the commercial solver CPLEX directly solves a basic formulation. Finally, we present a number of model and algorithmic extensions, including (1) an online algorithm that mirrors the structure of our decomposition method to serve well-spread ads in real time, (2) a model extension that allows an aggregator buying impressions in an external market to allocate them to advertisers in a well-spread manner, and (3) a multiperiod model and decomposition method that spreads impressions across both audience segments and time."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.44.1.1," R&D intensity and manufacturing performance were evaluated in this study of 600 durable goods firms in 20 countries. In a path-analytic model, R&D intensity was significantly associated with improvements in market share ( R 2 = 34%), controlling for firm size, previous market share, and regardless of industry or region of the world. Market share increases were also significantly correlated with improvements in manufacturing agility ( R 2 = 4%). Agility improvement was significantly correlated with R&D intensity, and computerization in manufacturing, controlling for firm size and region, and did exhibit industry effects, with electronic equipment firms elevated on this measure. Computerization exhibited regional (not industry) differences, with South American firms depressed on this measure. The role of computerization in manufacturing and agility in firm innovativeness are discussed."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0226," The abundance of transaction data available on the Internet tends to make information more transparent in electronic marketplaces. In such a transparent environment, it becomes easier for suppliers to obtain information that may allow them to infer their rivals’ costs. Is this good news or bad news? In this study, we focus on the informational effects of business-to-business (B2B) exchanges, and explore firms’ incentives to join a B2B exchange that provides an online platform for information transmission. We then study the equilibria by developing a game-theoretic model under asymmetric information. We examine whether the incentives to join a B2B exchange would be different under different competition modes (quantity and price), different information structures, and by varying the nature of the products (substitutes and complements). Our results challenge the “information transparency hypothesis” (i.e., open sharing of information in electronic markets is beneficial to all participating firms). In contrast to the popular belief, we show that information transparency could be a double-edged sword. The individual rationality of participation in the online exchange reflects the tradeoff between information transparency and data confidentiality. This may have important implications for the microstructure design (e.g., data access rules) of B2B electronic marketplaces."

Just 20 years ago, behavioral research within operations management was relatively small and dispersed.

In this article, we reflect on the research goals pursued in behavioral operations as well as the operational contexts explored. We also share thoughts on promising areas for future research."
/doi/10.1287/isre.13.3.334.81," Evidence suggests that consumers often hesitate to transact with Web-based vendors because of uncertainty about vendor behavior or the perceived risk of having personal information stolen by hackers. Trust plays a central role in helping consumers overcome perceptions of risk and insecurity. Trust makes consumers comfortable sharing personal information, making purchases, and acting on Web vendor advice—behaviors essential to widespread adoption of e-commerce. Therefore, trust is critical to both researchers and practitioners. Prior research on e-commerce trust has used diverse, incomplete, and inconsistent definitions of trust, making it difficult to compare results across studies. This paper contributes by proposing and validating measures for a multidisciplinary, multidimensional model of trust in e-commerce. The model includes four high-level constructs—disposition to trust, institution-based trust, trusting beliefs, and trusting intentions—which are further delineated into 16 measurable, literature-grounded subconstructs. The psychometric properties of the measures are demonstrated through use of a hypothetical, legal advice Web site. The results show that trust is indeed a multidimensional concept. Proposed relationships among the trust constructs are tested (for internal nomological validity), as are relationships between the trust constructs and three other e-commerce constructs (for external nomological validity), as Web experience, personal innovativeness, and Web site quality. Suggestions for future research as well as implications for practice are discussed."
/doi/10.1287/ijoc.2018.0819," We study the value of deterministic solutions, in particular their quality and upgradability, in addressing stochastic network design problems, by analyzing their time-dependent formulations known as scheduled service network design problems in freight transportation planning. We study several problem variants and models and investigate, for each case, the immediate quality of the deterministic solutions stemming from the 50th and the 75th percentile of the demand distributions. We then show that for all models, but in different ways, we are able to make effective use of parts of the deterministic solution, confirming the value of the deterministic solution in the stochastic environment, even when the deterministic solution itself performs badly. We also investigate what makes the optimal stochastic solution better in the stochastic environment than other feasible solutions, particularly those obtained by addressing deterministic versions of the problem. We do this by quantitatively analyzing the structures of different solutions. A measurement scheme is proposed to evaluate the level of potentially beneficial structural properties (multipath usage and path sharing) in different solutions. We show that these structural properties are important and correlated with the performance of a solution in the stochastic environment. Data and the online appendix are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.2018.0819 ."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2014.0530," Digital distribution channels raise many new challenges for managers in the media industry. This is particularly true for movie studios where high-value content can be stolen and released through illegitimate digital channels, even prior to the release of the movie in legal channels. In response to this potential threat, movie studios have spent millions of dollars to protect their content from unauthorized distribution throughout the lifecycle of films. They have focused their efforts on the pre-release period under the assumption that pre-release piracy could be particularly harmful for a movie’s success. However, surprisingly, there has been little rigorous research to analyze whether, and how much, pre-release movie piracy diminishes legitimate sales. In this paper, we analyze this question using data collected from a unique Internet file-sharing site. We find that, on average, pre-release piracy causes a 19.1% decrease in revenue compared to piracy that occurs post-release. Our study contributes to the growing literature on piracy and digital media consumption by presenting evidence of the impact of Internet-based movie piracy on sales and by analyzing pre-release piracy, a setting that is distinct from much of the existing literature."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2021.3969," Personalized marketing in retail requires a model to predict how different marketing actions affect product choices by individual customers. Large retailers often handle millions of transactions daily, involving thousands of products in hundreds of categories. Product choice models thus need to scale to large product assortments and customer bases, without extensive product attribute information. To address these challenges, we propose a custom deep neural network model. The model incorporates bottleneck layers to encode cross-product relationships, calibrates time-series filters to capture purchase dynamics for products with different interpurchase times, and relies on weight sharing between the products to improve convergence and scale to large assortments. The model applies to loyalty card transaction data without predefined categories or product attributes to predict customer-specific purchase probabilities in response to marketing actions. In a simulation, the proposed product choice model predicts purchase decisions better than baseline methods by adjusting the predicted probabilities for the effects of recent purchases and price discounts. The improved predictions lead to substantially higher revenue gains in a simulated coupon personalization problem. We verify predictive performance using transaction data from a large retailer with experimental variation in price discounts.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2125," We develop and estimate a dynamic structural framework to analyze the social-media content creation and consumption behavior of employees within an enterprise. We focus, in particular, on employees’ blogging behavior. The model incorporates two key features that are ubiquitous in blogging forums: users face (1) a trade-off between blog posting and blog reading; and (2) a trade-off between work-related and leisure-related content. We apply the model to a unique data set comprising the complete details of the blog posting and reading behavior of employees over a 15-month period at a Fortune 1000 IT services and consulting firm. Despite getting a higher utility from work-related blogging, employees nevertheless publish a significant number of leisure posts. This is partially because the creation of leisure posts has a significant positive spillover effect on the readership of work posts. Counterfactual experiments demonstrate that leisure-related blogging has positive spillovers for work-related blogging, and hence a policy of abolishing leisure-related content creation can inadvertently have adverse consequences on work-related content creation in an enterprise setting. When organizations restrict leisure blogging, the sharing of online work-related knowledge decreases and this in turn can also reduce employee performance rating. Overall, blogging within enterprises by employees during their work day can have positive long-term benefits for organizations. This paper was accepted by Lorin Hitt, information systems ."
/doi/10.1287/inte.2016.0861," For the past 12 years, the Chilean Professional Soccer Association (ANFP) has applied operations research (OR) techniques to schedule soccer leagues in Chile. Using integer programming-based methods, the ANFP decides which matches are played in each round, taking into account various objectives, such as holding down costs and ensuring engaging tournaments for the fans. It has scheduled more than 50 tournaments using this approach, resulting in an estimated direct economic impact of about $59 million, including reductions in television broadcaster operating costs, growth in soccer pay-television subscriptions, increased ticket revenue, and lower travel costs for the teams. This application of OR has also had significant noneconomic impacts. First, the incorporation of team requirements and various sporting criteria has improved process transparency and schedule fairness, increasing fans’ interest in local professional tournaments; second, because of the high portability of these techniques, they have been used successfully to schedule sports leagues in other countries (examples include volleyball and basketball in Argentina, and the South American qualifiers for the 2018 Soccer World Cup). Furthermore, the models and methods used in this scheduling application have been disseminated widely, helping to promote OR as an effective tool for addressing practical problems. Our outreach activities have reached thousands of high school and university students in four countries and a more general audience of millions of television viewers and Internet users."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2015.0995," We examine the role of past rejections in the evolution of market relationships. We identify a theoretical tension between the informational benefits and the negative affect resulting from interactions in which one actor rejected another. Rejection can help select future mutually beneficial transactions, but it can also trigger negative affect and lead rejected actors to decline exchange opportunities with those who rejected them in the past. We test this theory with longitudinal data on candidates considered by an executive search firm, using insights from fieldwork and interviews to understand better what motivates the parties’ reactions to being rejected. This paper contributes to research on relationship evolution and highlights the importance of handling rejection in market interactions."
/doi/10.1287/isre.11.1.61.11783," Recent theoretical work suggests that network externalities are a determinant of network adoption. However, few empirical studies have reported the impact of network externalities on the adoption of networks. As a result, little is known about the extent to which network externalities may influence network adoption and diffusion. Using electronic banking as a context and an econometric technique called hazard modeling , this research examines empirically the impact of network externalities and other influences that combine to determine network membership. The results support the network externalities hypothesis . We find that banks in markets that can generate a larger effective network size and a higher level of externalities tend to adopt early, while the size of a bank's own branch network (a proxy for the opportunity cost of adoption)decreases the probability of early adoption."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0716," This paper studies a procurement problem with one buyer and multiple potential suppliers who hold private information about their own production costs. Both the purchase quantity and the price need to be determined. An optimal procurement strategy for the buyer requires the buyer to first design a supply contract that specifies a payment for each possible purchase quantity and then invites the suppliers to bid for this contract. The auction can be conducted in many formats such as the English auction, the Dutch auction, the first-priced, sealed-bid auction, and the Vickrey auction. The winner is the supplier with the highest bid, and is given the decision right for the quantity produced and delivered. Applying this theory to a newsvendor model with supply-side competition, this paper establishes a connection between the above optimal procurement strategy and a common practice in the retail industry, namely, the use of slotting allowances and vendor-managed inventory. Also discussed in the newsvendor context are the role of well-known supply contracts such as returns contracts and revenue-sharing contracts in procurement auctions, the scenarios where the buyer and suppliers may possess asymmetric information about the demand distribution, and how the cost of supply-demand mismatch is affected by supply-side competition. Finally, this paper compares the optimal procurement strategy with a simpler but suboptimal strategy where the buyer first determines a purchase quantity and then seeks the lowest-cost supplier for the quantity in an auction."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2018.0823," Strategic alliances have become popular organizational forms in the last two decades. Prior research suggests alliances promote knowledge sharing between the partners. In this research, using patent data, we study the impact of information technology (IT) intensity on knowledge flows in alliances. Research has shown that prealliance knowledge stocks of the partners facilitate knowledge flows to the focal firm. We find that knowledge flows to the focal firm are enhanced when the focal firm and its partner have high IT intensity. We find support for our theorizing that IT is a necessary complementary resource that facilitates knowledge flows among partners in alliances."
/doi/10.1287/moor.2021.1144," We present a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for computing d d + o ( d ) -approximate (pure) Nash equilibria in (proportional sharing) weighted congestion games with polynomial cost functions of degree at most d . This is an exponential improvement of the approximation factor with respect to the previously best deterministic algorithm. An appealing additional feature of the algorithm is that it only uses best-improvement steps in the actual game, as opposed to the previously best algorithms, that first had to transform the game itself. Our algorithm is an adaptation of the seminal algorithm by Caragiannis at al. [Caragiannis I, Fanelli A, Gravin N, Skopalik A (2011) Efficient computation of approximate pure Nash equilibria in congestion games. Ostrovsky R, ed. Proc. 52nd Annual Symp. Foundations Comput. Sci.

ACM Trans. Econom. Comput. 3(1):2:1–2:32.], but we utilize an approximate potential function directly on the original game instead of an exact one on a modified game. A critical component of our analysis, which is of independent interest, is the derivation of a novel bound of [ d / W ( d / ρ ) ] d + 1 for the price of anarchy (PoA) of ρ -approximate equilibria in weighted congestion games, where W is the Lambert-W function. More specifically, we show that this PoA is exactly equal to Φ d , ρ d + 1 , where Φ d , ρ is the unique positive solution of the equation ρ ( x + 1 ) d = x d + 1 . Our upper bound is derived via a smoothness-like argument, and thus holds even for mixed Nash and correlated equilibria, whereas our lower bound is simple enough to apply even to singleton congestion games."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2604," We analyze the entry of new credit rating agencies into structured finance products. Our setting is unique as we study a period in which the incumbents’ reputation was extremely poor and the benefit of more fee income from inflating ratings was low. We find entrants issue higher ratings than incumbents, particularly for interest-only tranches. Using measures of market share that are exogenous to incumbent ratings, we provide suggestive evidence that incumbent rating levels become more generous as entrant market share in a product type increases. We also exploit a feature of structured finance that identifies rating shopping and find that incumbent ratings increase in shopping.

/doi/10.1287/stsc.2020.0105," Collective action is critical for successful market formation. However, relatively little is known about how and under what conditions actors overcome collective action problems to successfully form new markets. Using the benefits of simulation methods, we uncover how collective action problems result from actor resource allocation decisions interacting with each other and how the severity of these problems depends on central market- and actor-related characteristics. Specifically, we show that collective action problems occur when actors undervalue the benefits of market-oriented resource allocation and when actors contribute resources that are imperfectly substitutable. Furthermore, we show that collective action problems occur when actors are embedded in networks with others sharing a similar role in market formation. Collectively, our findings contribute new insights to organization theory regarding collective action and market formation and to strategy on value creation and strategic decision making regarding resource allocation."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2018.1229," This study considers the nascent period of industry change when the prevalent business model is being threatened by a new model, but there is significant uncertainty with respect to whether and when the new model will dominate. We focus on the challenge of incumbents pursuing both models simultaneously during the nascent period, and the implications on their firms’ valuations. Our theory is premised on the adjustment costs incurred by incumbents associated with the sharing of resources across business models and the conflict between managers vying for limited resources. While firms’ assets and competitive environments are key drivers of their value, we argue that they also impact adjustment costs. Evidence from the U.S. electric utility industry, which is undergoing a change from a centralized to a decentralized model, offers strong support for our arguments. The greater the level of incumbents’ assets that are specific to the existing model, and the greater the level of competition that they face, the lower are their firms’ valuations when investing in the new model relative to when investing in the existing model. Hence, ironically, those incumbents potentially most threatened by the change seem to be least rewarded for their efforts to renew themselves. However, pursuing the new model via alliances can help mitigate adjustment costs. The study uncovers the challenges that incumbents face as they pursue the new model in tandem with the existing dominant model, and helps explain why some incumbents may successfully navigate the changing industry landscape while others may stumble."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.1110.0712," This study investigates the determinants of bridging ties within networks of interconnected firms. Bridging ties are defined as nonredundant connections between firms located in different network communities. We highlight how firms can enter into these relationships because of the incentives and opportunities for action that are embedded in the existing network structure. Specifically, we propose that the dynamics of proximate network structures, which reflect firms' and their partners' direct connections, affect the formation of bridging ties by shaping the value-creation and value-distribution incentives for bridging. We also argue that the evolving global network structure affects firms' propensity to form bridging ties by shaping the structural opportunities for bridging. We test our theory using the network of partnership ties among firms in the global computer industry from 1991 to 2005. We find support for structural incentives and opportunities as influential precursors of bridging ties."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0439," This paper examines whether “you get what you pay for” in firms that implement residual income (RI)–based compensation. Specifically, this paper explores differences in investment patterns of firms that implement RI-based compensation plans conditional on whether the firms switched from earnings or return on investment (ROI)–based compensation. I find that the pattern of investment for firms switching to RI from earnings-based compensation is opposite to that of firms switching from ROI-based compensation. Changes in investment within each individual subgroup yield weaker, mixed results. In addition, this paper documents that delivered RI increases in firms that implement RI. My paper contributes to the literature on the investment effects of RI by examining the relevance of a set of arguments that have been made in management accounting textbooks since 1965. These arguments are still found in current textbooks and are commonly taught to students in graduate level managerial accounting classes. The arguments help us to examine a natural experiment in which we can better specify the conditions under which RI use is expected to be associated with changes in investment."

/doi/10.1287/trsc.2016.0712," The impacts of autonomous vehicles, coupled with greater inter-vehicle and system connectivity, may be far-reaching on several levels. They entail changes to (1) the demand and behavior side, (2) the supply of mobility services, and (3) network and facility operational performance. We focus here on their impact on traffic flow and operations, especially in mixed traffic situations in which autonomous vehicles share the road with regular, human-driven vehicles, along with connected vehicles that may also have some automated functions. These mixed traffic situations correspond to likely deployment scenarios of the technologies, especially in the long transition towards 100% deployment. We explain using elementary traffic science concepts how autonomous vehicles and connected vehicles are expected to increase the throughput of highway facilities, as well as improve the stability of the traffic stream. A microsimulation framework featuring varying behavioral mechanisms for the three classes of vehicles is introduced. The framework is used to examine the throughput and stability questions through a series of experiments under varying market penetration rates of autonomous and/or connected vehicles; at low market shares, the impacts are relatively minor on either throughput or stability. However, as market shares increase, autonomous vehicles exert a greater influence on both dimensions compared to the same shares of connected vehicles. Applications of the framework to examine the effectiveness of selected traffic management approaches are discussed, including dedicated lanes for autonomous vehicles (good only if its use is optional and when the market share of autonomous vehicles is greater than the percentage of nominal capacity represented by that lane), and speed harmonization."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.13.12.B781," A study of irrigation, economics was conducted in 1963 on a 10,000 acre sugar plantation in Hawaii and repeated in 1964 on three additional plantations covering 34,000 acres. The objective of the study was to recommend, on an agronomic and economic basis, a program for investing large amounts of capital in newly developed automatic and semi-automatic irrigation systems. Although basically a problem in capital budgeting, a number of complicating factors precluded the straightforward application of traditional investment analysis techniques. The more important of these factors were: 1. Many Alternatives . The wide range of physical conditions found on each plantation ruled out the selection of a single “best” irrigation system. As a result, a number of systems had to be evaluated for each of several hundred cane fields. 2. Combinatorial Aspects . Investments in individual cane fields were interdependent since groups of fields shared common water sources; thus, combinations of investments had to be analyzed, increasing the number of investment alternatives astronomically. 3. Opportunity Value of Scarce Resources . New irrigation systems offered substantial water savings. However, the value of these savings arises from the “opportunity” value of water in alternative uses. Alternative uses, in turn, depend on how much water is saved. Thus, no value for potential savings on the plantation could be established until the investment analysis was run, first for individual alternatives and then for combinations of alternatives. 4. Complicated Timing . Because of crop planting schedules, new systems would be installed on small increments of acreage over a period of 8 to 10 years. Thus, “nonconventional” investments (outlays interspersed with benefits such that the stream of cash flows had multiple sign changes) occurred in multiple time periods; furthermore, because of crop harvesting schedules, returns from these investments also were distributed over multiple time periods with varying amounts of delay between investments and returns. The approach used to solve this problem is described in the paper."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2013.0859," Because of the predominance of the assumption of profit maximization as the goal of the firm and its decision makers, especially in the competitive strategy literature, research has yet to investigate how differences in objectives might influence competitive actions such as entry, exit, and pricing decisions. This represents an important gap in the literature given the fundamental role of objectives in decision making and widespread evidence that many firms, especially those that are closely held, are motivated by nonfinancial objectives in addition to an interest in financial returns. To further our understanding of firms’ competitive strategy decisions, we discuss how the presence of nonfinancial objectives in closely held firms leads to a weakening of the relationship between economic indications of profitability and competitive behaviors. Using a unique data set of nearly 4,000 closely held and non-closely held establishments engaged in local competition in the Texas hotel industry, we find that the entry, exit, and pricing decisions of closely held establishments are less responsive to economic indicators of profit potential compared with decisions of non-closely held establishments."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2015.0575," Advances in the digital economy have driven the trend among manufacturers, particularly those in the information technology (IT) industry, to offer products that consumers can self-customize to satisfy their idiosyncratic needs. This study examines firm strategies on offering such consumer-customizable products. Our analysis shows that a monopolistic firm obtains a greater profit from offering a consumer-customizable product than from offering a preconfigured standardized product only if consumers are sufficiently capable to conduct the customization task; otherwise, it is more profitable for the firm to offer a standardized product. Moreover, consumers obtain a greater surplus when the firm offers the customizable product. We also consider the case where the firm is capable of offering both a customizable product and a standardized product and find that the firm benefits more from offering both products than offering either product if consumer customizing capability and the customization cost are not too high. Interestingly, when the firm offers both products, its effort in enhancing consumer customizability (e.g., offering free consumer training) always benefits both the firm and consumers, but its effort in increasing the value of the standardized product (e.g., offering more functions) can hurt both the firm profit and consumer surplus. Our theoretical results explain many interesting business practices and provide useful insights for marketing practitioners."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.1040.0094," The paper examines managing knowledge across boundaries in settings where innovation is desired. Innovation is a useful context because it allows us to explore the negative consequences of the path-dependent nature of knowledge. A framework is developed that describes three progressively complex boundaries—syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic—and three progressively complex processes—transfer, translation, and transformation. The framework is used to specify the practical and political mismatches that occur when innovation is desired and how this relates to the common knowledge that actors use to share and assess each other's domain-specific knowledge. The development and use of a collaborative engineering tool in the early stages of a vehicle's development is presented to illustrate the conceptual and prescriptive value of the framework. The implication of this framework on key topics in the organization theory and strategy literatures is then discussed."
/doi/10.1287/isre.1040.0023," Online spaces that enable shared public interpersonal communications are of significant social, organizational, and economic importance. In this paper, a theoretical model and associated unobtrusive method are proposed for researching the relationship between online spaces and the behavior they host. The model focuses on the collective impact that individual information-overload coping strategies have on the dynamics of open, interactive public online group discourse. Empirical research was undertaken to assess the validity of both the method and the model, based on the analysis of over 2.65 million postings to 600 Usenet newsgroups over a 6-month period. Our findings support the assertion that individual strategies for coping with “information overload” have an observable impact on large-scale online group discourse. Evidence was found for the hypotheses that: (1) users are more likely to respond to simpler messages in overloaded mass interaction; (2) users are more likely to end active participation as the overloading of mass interaction increases; and (3) users are more likely to generate simpler responses as the overloading of mass interaction grows. The theoretical model outlined offers insight into aspects of computer-mediated communication tool usability, technology design, and provides a road map for future empirical research."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2016.0594," Motivated by a collaborative study with one of the most comprehensive ocular imaging programs in the United States, we investigate the underlying three-way trade-off among operational, clinical, and financial considerations in physicians’ decisions about ordering imaging tests. Laboratory tests may be processed in parallel and thus have a limited effect on patients’ waiting times; imaging tests, by contrast, require patient presence and thus directly influence patients’ waiting times. We use a strategic queueing framework to model a physician’s decision of ordering imaging tests and show that insurance coverage is the key driver of overtesting. Our further analysis reveals the following: (i) Whereas existing studies hold that lower out-of-pocket expenses lead to higher consumption levels, we refine this statement by showing the copayment and the coinsurance rate drive the consumption in different directions. Thus, simply expanding patient cost sharing is not the solution to overtesting. (ii) Setting a low reimbursement ceiling alone cannot eliminate overtesting. (iii) The joint effect of misdiagnosis concerns and insurance coverage can lead to both overtesting and undertesting even when no reimbursement ceiling exists. These and other results continue to hold under more general conditions and are therefore robust. We enrich our model along two extensions: one with patient heterogeneity in diagnostic precision, and the other with disparities in health insurance coverage.

It is in this context that new forms of organizing, such as online groups, have emerged. However, the same factors that underlie the utopian narrative of Internet life also give rise to numerous online groups, many of which fail to attract participants or to provide significant value. This suggests that despite the potential transformative nature of modern information technology, issues of scarcity, competition, and context may remain critical to the performance and functioning of online groups. In this paper, we draw from organizational ecology theories to develop an ecological view of online groups to explain how overlapping membership among online groups causes intergroup competition for member attention and affects a group's ability to grow. Hypotheses regarding the effects of group size, age, and membership overlap on growth are proposed and tested with data from a 64-month, longitudinal sample of 240 online discussion groups. The analysis shows that sharing members with other groups reduced future growth rates, suggesting that membership overlap puts competitive pressure on online groups. Our results also suggest that, compared with smaller and younger groups, larger and older groups experience greater difficulty in growing their membership. In addition, larger groups were more vulnerable to competitive pressure than smaller groups: larger groups experienced greater difficulty in growing their membership than smaller groups as competition intensified. Overall, our findings show how an abundance of opportunities afforded by technologies can create scarcity in user time and effort, which increases competitive pressure on online groups. Our ecological view extends organizational ecology theory to new organizational forms online and highlights the importance of studying the competitive environment of online groups."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.18.2.137," Considering the number of new product introductions and available product varieties today, the practice of product proliferation is visibly evident in many diverse industries. Given its prevalence in practice, understanding the determinants and implications of firm proliferation strategies clearly has important managerial relevance. Previous theoretical research has identified three primary effects of a proliferation strategy: (1) a broad product line can increase the overall demand faced by the firm, (2) a broad product line can affect supply by increasing costs, and (3) broad product lines can have strategic consequences (e.g., long product lines can deter entry, thereby allowing an incumbent firm to raise prices). However, despite the theoretical interest in this common business practice, there has been very little empirical research on this topic. Moreover, no empirical study has simultaneously considered all three of the possible effects associated with a proliferation strategy. Consequently, in this paper we propose a three-equation simultaneous system that captures both the determinants and market outcomes of a firm's product line decisions. In particular, we specify market share, price, and product line length equations, which are estimated by three stage least squares. Using this structure, we empirically study the personal computer industry over the period 1981–1992. Our empirical results demonstrate that proliferation strategies do not have a uni-dimensional explanation. We find that product proliferation decisions have both demand (market share) and supply (price) implications. Our empirical results also suggest that the firm-level net market share impact of product proliferation in the personal computer industry is negative (i.e., the cost increases associated with a broader product line dominate any potential demand increases). As expected, we find that structural competitive factors play an important role in the determinants and market outcomes of a firm's product line decisions. However, we do not find evidence of firms using proliferation strategies to deter entry in this industry. Finally, we also demonstrate that some of the empirical conclusions from previous research are reversed once product line length is specified as endogenous in the share and price specifications."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3499," We integrate the results of a social network survey and a forecast information sharing experiment to examine the roles of trust and trustworthiness in impacting high-ranking executives’ decisions in supply chain interactions. The members of our executive sample have, on average, 17 years of work experience. A significant portion of them holds positions at the C-level in world-leading organizations that span a wide range of industries. By examining the roles of trust and trustworthiness in the decision making of high-ranking executives, we find strong external validation for as well as demonstrate how these nonpecuniary, behavioral factors impact the outcomes of business interactions. We employ a multimethod research design that allows us to investigate the extent to which the executives’ trust beliefs toward a relevant network of exchange partners (which we define as their “network trust”) impact their trust behaviors when engaging in business interactions with members of this network. We determine the conditions pertaining to the executives’ professional experiences that strengthen or weaken the impact of network trust on the executives’ trust behaviors in supply chain interactions. For example, executives with more diverse professional experiences rely more on network trust to shape their trust behaviors. Conversely, executives with prior positive trust experiences rely less on network trust in their trusting behaviors. We quantify that improved trust and trustworthiness can yield up to 41%, 6%, and 5% gain in the expected profit of the supplier, the retailer, and the supply chain. Our results offer tangible implications for how organizations can better leverage executives’ knowledge about how much to rely on network trust in business interactions to achieve better outcomes.

/doi/10.1287/mksc.2017.1068," Firms often learn about their own capabilities through their products’ successes and failures. This paper explores the interaction between learning about capabilities and product strategy in a formal model. We consider a firm that can launch a sequence of products, where each product’s success probability depends on the fit between the firm’s capabilities and the product. A successful new product always causes the firm to become more optimistic about the capability most relevant for that product; however, it can also cause the firm to become less optimistic about some of its other capabilities, including capabilities the new product does not use. The firm’s optimal forward-looking product strategy accounts for short-run expected profits as well as for the information value of learning for future decisions. We find that a product sharing few or even no capabilities with potential future products can have a greater information value than a product that shares more capabilities with future products and that learning about capabilities can affect the optimal sequence of product launch decisions. Data and the online appendix are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2017.1068 ."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.47.1.173.10673," This paper examines the relationship between product architecture, supply-chain performance metrics, and supply-chain efficiency. We model the contracting relationship between a supplier and a buyer. The supplier is privately informed about the outcome of his design/production investment. The buyer both appraises the supplier's component and does further processing/component production of his own. If the final product produced by the buyer exhibits decoupling and no function sharing with respect to the components (termed separable architecture), the first-best outcome is attained if both internal and external failures are contractible. When only one type of failure can be contracted on, we derive conditions under which contracting on internal failure is superior to contracting on external failure, and vice versa. If the buyer's final product has a nonseparable architecture with respect to the components, first-best cannot be achieved even if both internal and external failures are contractible. The value of contracting on internal failure alone is unaffected by the architecture design, while that of external failure declines relative to the separable setting; the net result is often to make the former the uniformly dominant performance metric. Our results highlight the interaction between the performance metrics used for contracting within the supply chain, the architecture of the product produced by the supply chain, and the incentive efficiency of the chain."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2020.3878," How does public data shape the relative performance of incumbents and entrants in the private sector? Using a simple theoretical framework, I argue that public data reduces investment uncertainty, facilitates the discovery of new market opportunities, and increases the relative market share of new entrants relative to incumbents. I shed light on these predictions by estimating the impact of public data from Landsat, a U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration satellite mapping program, on the discovery rates of new deposits by incumbents (seniors) and entrants (juniors) in the gold exploration industry. I exploit idiosyncratic timing variation and cloud cover in Landsat coverage across regions to identify the causal effect of public data on the patterns of gold discovery. I find that Landsat data nearly doubled the rate of significant gold discoveries after a region was mapped and increased the market share of new entrants from about 10% to 25%. Public data seem to play an important, yet relatively underexplored, role in driving performance differences across firms. This paper was accepted by Ashish Arora, entrepreneurship and innovation."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0637," Given the importance of proximity for knowledge spillovers, we examine firms’ location choices expecting differences in firms’ strategies. Firms will locate to maximize their net spillovers as a function of locations’ knowledge activity, their own capabilities, and competitors’ anticipated actions. Using new entrants into the United States from 1985 to 1994, we find that firms favor locations with academic innovative activity. Other results highlight differences in firms’ location strategies suggesting that firms consider not only gains from inward knowledge spillovers but also the possible cost of outward spillovers. While less technologically advanced firms favor locations with high levels of industrial innovative activity, technologically advanced firms choose only locations with high levels of academic activity and avoid locations with industrial activity to distance themselves from competitors."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.1070.0271," When designing price contracts, one of the major questions confronting managers is how many blocks there should be in the contract. We investigate this question in the setting of a manufacturer-retailer dyad facing a linear deterministic consumer demand. Theoretical marketing models predict that the manufacturer’s profits rise dramatically when the number of blocks in the contract is increased from one to two because both channel efficiency and its share of channel profits increase. However, increasing the number of blocks to three yields no incremental profits. We test these predictions experimentally and find that increasing the number of blocks from one to two raises channel efficiency but not the manufacturer’s share of profits. Surprisingly, having three blocks in the contract increases channel efficiency even further and also gives the manufacturer a slightly higher share of profits. We show that these results can be explained by a quantal response equilibrium model in which the manufacturer accounts for noisy best response due to nonpecuniary payoff components in the retailer’s utility. We also show that the retailer is sensitive to the counterfactual profits it could have earned if it were charged a lower marginal price for earlier blocks in the multiple-block contract."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0350," The trust-building process is basic to social science. We investigate it in a laboratory setting using a novel multistage trust game where social gains are achieved if players trust each other in each stage. In each stage, also, players have an opportunity to appropriate these gains or be trustworthy by sharing them. Players are strangers because they do not know the identity of others and they will not play them again. Thus, there is no prospect of future interaction to induce trusting behavior, and we study the trust-building process where there is little scope for social relations and networks. Standard game theory, which assumes all players are opportunistic and untrustworthy and thus should have zero trust for others, is used to construct a null hypothesis. We test whether people are trusting or trustworthy and examine how inferring the intentions of those who trust affects trustworthiness. We also investigate the effect of stake on trust, and study the evolution of trust. Results show subjects exhibit some degree of trusting behavior, although a majority of them are not trustworthy and claim the entire social gain. Players are more reluctant to trust in later stages than in earlier ones and are more trustworthy if they are certain of the trustee’s intention. Surprisingly, subjects are more trusting and trustworthy when the stake size increases. Finally, we find the subpopulation that invests in initiating the trust-building process modifies its trusting behavior based on the relative fitness of trust."

The system uses forecasting, discrete-event simulation, and optimization (solved with meta-heuristic algorithms) to provide an integrated approach to revenue and capacity management. Opticar anticipates future demand for Europcar’s vehicle fleet up to six months in advance, thus improving fleet capacity management (vehicle acquisitions, decommissions, and transfers). In addition, it enables Europcar to optimize its approach to revenue management and rental pricing, taking into account its currently available fleet, competitor information, and the expected demand for vehicles. Opticar provides a mathematical approach, which managers in nine countries share and use as a starting point for all daily operations."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1090.0997," Previous research suggests firms can build a market share advantage by preempting later entrants with a broad product line and expanding rapidly into related markets. Whether such a strategy leads to a pioneering profit advantage relative to followers also depends on its cost effects. In this paper, we examine when the market share advantage of a pioneering firm with a broad product line strategy translates into a profit advantage by examining the cost effects of this strategy. Using the profit impact of marketing strategies data and an estimation method that controls for various unobserved factors, we find significant differences between different industry settings. From these contrasting findings, we generate an emerging theoretical framework that we subject to empirical testing. We conjecture, and empirically verify, that creating a broad product line with a versioning strategy—creating variety from a standard product in anticipating customer demand—does not increase the pioneering cost disadvantage, and thus results in a pioneering profit advantage. On the other hand, with a tailoring strategy—creating variety by customizing a product to actual customer demand—a broad product line substantially increases the pioneering cost disadvantage, thereby making a preemption strategy counterproductive."
/doi/10.1287/trsc.2015.0659," Forecasting the potential demand for electric vehicles is a challenging task. Because most studies for new technologies rely on stated preference (SP) data, market share predictions will reflect shares in the SP data and not in the real market. Moreover, typical disaggregate demand models are suitable to forecast demand in relatively stable markets, but show limitations in the case of innovations. When predicting the market for new products it is crucial to account for the role played by innovation and how it penetrates the new market over time through a diffusion process. However, typical diffusion models in marketing research use fairly simple demand models. In this paper we discuss the problem of predicting market shares for new products and suggest a method that combines advanced choice models with a diffusion model to take into account that new products often need time to gain a significant market share. We have the advantage of a relatively unique databank where respondents were submitted to the same stated choice experiment before and after experiencing an electric vehicle. Results show that typical choice models forecast a demand that is too restrictive in the long period. Accounting for the diffusion effect, instead allows predicting the usual slow penetration of a new product in the initial years after product launch and a faster market share increase after diffusion takes place."
/doi/10.1287/isre.1040.0035," Information technology (IT) outsourcing success requires careful management of customer-supplier relationships. However, there are few published studies on the ongoing relationships, and most of these adopt a customer perspective, de-emphasizing suppliers. In this study, we look at both customer and supplier perspectives, by means of the psychological contract of customer and supplier project managers. We apply the concept of psychological contract to perceived mutual obligations, and to how such fulfillment of obligations can predict success. Our research questions are (1) What are the critical customer-supplier obligations in an IT outsourcing relationship? and (2) What is the impact of fulfilling these obligations on success? We use a sequential, qualitative-quantitative approach to develop and test our model. In the qualitative study, we probe the nature of customer-supplier obligations using in-depth interviews. Content analysis of interview transcripts show that both customers and suppliers identify six obligations that are critical to success. Customers perceive supplier obligations to be accurate project scoping, clear authority structures, taking charge, effective human capital management, effective knowledge transfer, and effective interorganizational teams. Suppliers perceive customer obligations as clear specifications, prompt payment, close project monitoring, dedicated project staffing, knowledge sharing, and project ownership. In the second quantitative study, we assess the impact of fulfilling these obligations on success through a field study of 370 managers. Results show that fulfilled obligations predict success over and above the effects of contract type, duration, and size."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2020.0969," Firm relations, which inform the competitive environments of firms, are critical to firm operations and are often factored into investor decisions. Previous studies and practices have considered relatively stable and long-term business relations as an indicator of firm market value. Public news often reports on business relations, especially dynamic and short-term opportunities and challenges involving different partners. Learning about firm relations from news is commonly done by human investors but has not been studied systematically in previous research, leading to a research opportunity in market signaling via dynamic firm relations . In this study, we propose a new approach to market signaling by leveraging text-mining methods to extract cobenefit/counter-benefit networks based on firms’ mutual or conflicting interests in business events. We find that the resulting networks in the long term are partially aligned with firm cooperation and competition relationships, confirming their semantic implications for investor perception and attention. Our empirical study further shows that dynamic networks formed in a short time period (measured by firm centrality in networks) have significant impacts on firm equity value, after controlling for market activities and other information from news, such as volume, sentiment, and comentions. We show that dynamic networks can provide additional value in predicting firm equity value over stable networks. Moreover, the negative effects of counter-benefit networks emerge rapidly and persist longer than the positive effects of cobenefit networks. This study provides new insights into investor perception of news and suggests new research directions for financial text mining. Our research findings on market signaling via news-induced networks also have an impact on financial practices, such as market analysis and automatic trading."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2021.4127," Decades of research suggest that information exchange in groups and organizations can reliably improve judgment accuracy in tasks such as financial forecasting, market research, and medical decision making. However, we show that improving the accuracy of numeric estimates does not necessarily improve the accuracy of decisions. For binary-choice judgments, also known as classification tasks—for example, yes/no or build/buy decisions—social influence is most likely to grow the majority vote share, regardless of the accuracy of that opinion. As a result, initially, inaccurate groups become increasingly inaccurate after information exchange, even as they signal stronger support. We term this dynamic the “crowd classification problem.” Using both a novel data set and a reanalysis of three previous data sets, we study this process in two types of information exchange: (1) when people share votes only, and (2) when people form and exchange numeric estimates prior to voting. Surprisingly, when people exchange numeric estimates prior to voting, the binary-choice vote can become less accurate, even as the average numeric estimate becomes more accurate. Our findings recommend against voting as a form of decision making when groups are optimizing for accuracy. For those cases where voting is required, we discuss strategies for managing communication to avoid the crowd classification problem. We close with a discussion of how our results contribute to a broader contingency theory of collective intelligence. This paper was accepted by Lamar Pierce, organizations."
/doi/10.1287/isre.1090.0256," Digital inequality, or unequal access to and use of information and communication technologies (ICT), is a severe problem preventing the socioeconomically disadvantaged (SED) from participating in a digital society. To understand the critical resources that contribute to digital inequality and inform public policy for stimulating initial and continued ICT usage by the SED, we drew on capital theories and conducted a field study to investigate: (1) the forms of capital for using ICT and how they differ across potential adopters who are SED and socioeconomically advantaged (SEA); (2) how these forms of capitals are relatively impacted for the SEA and the SED through public policy for ICT access; and (3) how each form of capital influences the SED's intentions to use initially and to continue to use ICT. The context for our study involved a city in the southeastern United States that offered its citizens free ICT access for Internet connectivity. Our results show that SED potential adopters exhibited lower cultural capital but higher social capital relative to the SEA. Moreover, the SED who participated in the city's initiative realized greater positive gains in cultural capital, social capital, and habitus than the SEA. In addition, we find that the SED's initial intention to use ICT was influenced by intrinsic motivation for habitus, self-efficacy for cultural capital, and important referents' expectations and support from acquaintances for social capital. Cultural capital and social cultural capital also complemented each other in driving the SED's initial use intention. The SED's continued use intention was affected by both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for habitus and both knowledge and self-efficacy for cultural capital but was not affected by social capital. We also make several recommendations for future research on digital inequality and ICT acceptance to extend and apply the proposed capital framework."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.11.3.356.12498," In my early “Processing Fads and Fashions: An Organization-Set Analysis of Cultural Industry Systems” (1972), the middle “throughput” phase, or most organizational aspect of cultural industries, was emphasized. In this depoliticized exploration of what Adorno (1991) had earlier characterized as the industrialization of high culture, and Powdermaker (1950) as Hollywood's “dream factory,” I emphasized the key roles of gatekeeper and distributor organizations as critical in connecting the artist/creators to audience/consumers of mass, or “popular” culture (as it had more acceptingly come to be called). Altogether, this network of organizations—from creators (artists, musicians, actors, writers) and brokers (agents), through the cultural product's producers (publishers, studios), distributors (wholesalers, theaters), and media outlets—collectively constitute cultural industries . This article on industries producing “cultural products”—defined as “ ‘nonmaterial’ goods directed at a public of consumers, for whom they generally serve an esthetic or expressive, rather than a clearly utilitarian function” (Hirsch 1972 p. 641)—appeared at the same time that organizational sociology's focus on what became known as the “production of culture” took off, and continued to flourish into the 1990s (Peterson 1994, Crane 1992). How has the study of cultural industries changed over the last generation? A simple answer is that the subject—the key role of distribution and the importance of organizational middlemen in the making and sale of popular culture—remains analytically the same. From actors, musicians, and writers; through studios, labels and publishers, to videocassettes, movie theaters, record stores, and booksellers (in stores or via the Internet)—cultural products flow. How this sequence is organized and traversed remains a fascinating forest of power plays and techniques, employed by role-occupants in the same positions as have existed since the advent of mass media. While this substantive field has changed little analytically, what we also see is a wondrous expansion in the disciplinary approaches being taken to examine the multitude of topics available for examination under the broad rubric and framing of the term, “cultural industries.” Because I was a graduate student at the time (my roommate dared me to submit the “Processing…” paper to the American Journal of Sociology ), it is a great pleasure to find the concept has retained its value for other researchers since that time. In this article, I will (1) reexamine and discuss the original framing of the term cultural industries ; (2) briefly review some of the more recent complementary perspectives which expand the possible arenas for studying this topic; and (3) append a short note on how the more recent inclusion of nonprofit cultural products (e.g., symphonies, museums) in this framework poses interesting analytical questions and opportunities."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2962," Governments use consumer incentives to promote green technologies (e.g., solar panels and electric vehicles). Our goal in this paper is to study how policy adjustments over time will interact with production decisions from the industry. We model the interaction between a government and an industry player in a two-period game setting under uncertain demand. We show how the timing of decisions affects the risk sharing between the government and the supplier, ultimately affecting the cost of the subsidy program. In particular, we show that when the government commits to a fixed policy, it encourages the supplier to produce more at the beginning of the horizon. Consequently, a flexible subsidy policy is on average more expensive, unless there is a significant negative demand correlation across time periods. However, we show that the variance of the total sales is lower in the flexible setting, implying that the government’s additional spending reduces the adoption level uncertainty. In addition, we show that for flexible policies, the supplier is better off in terms of expected profits, whereas the consumers can either benefit or not depending on the price elasticity of demand. Finally, we test our insights with a numerical example calibrated on data from a solar subsidy program. This paper was accepted by Gad Allon, operations management."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2021.4034," Involving suppliers deep in the supply chain is critical for the success of environmental and social responsibility (ESR) initiatives. Administering ESR programs throughout a complex supply network, however, is challenging. In this paper, we apply a multiunit bilateral bargaining framework to coordinate ESR investments in a general supply network and analyze to what extent an ESR initiator should directly engage the higher-tier suppliers as opposed to delegating that responsibility to the first-tier suppliers. Our bargaining framework not only generalizes the conventional Shapley value approach by allowing the flexibility of modeling imbalanced power distribution among the firms but also provides an explicit way of implementing the resulting gain sharing among the firms through negotiated contract terms. We show that the eventual structure of ESR negotiation relationships can be derived by finding a shortest path tree in the supply network with the arc cost defined as the logarithm of the negotiating parties’ relative bargaining power. These developments allow us to analyze ESR implementation in generally extended supply networks. We find that the ESR initiator tends to delegate ESR negotiations to a supplier that is strong in negotiations with higher-tier suppliers. When the supply network is complex (i.e., wide and deep), directly engaging all suppliers can lead to a larger gain by the initiator than fully delegating the negotiations with higher-tier suppliers to the first-tier ones. However, as the network gets increasingly complex, the ESR initiator tends to directly engage a reduced percentage of higher-tier suppliers. We further extend our analysis to situations where the ESR relationships are sequentially formed in a decentralized manner, where the benefit of ESR depends on the collective choice of the firms’ investment levels, where multiple ESR programs are implemented in the network, and where ESR investments depend on the negotiation relationships.

/doi/10.1287/orsc.2019.1352," The mechanisms by which social networks and organizational vocabularies combine jointly to affect communication patterns across organizational boundaries remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we examine the mutually constitutive relation between the network ties through which organizational members communicate with each other and the vocabularies that they use to describe their organization. We suggest that the dynamic structure of social networks and organizational vocabularies is contingent on the formal design of organizational subunits. Within subunit boundaries, members who interact with each other are more likely to develop similar vocabularies over time. Interestingly, between subunits, the more two members share similar organizational vocabularies, the more likely they are to form a tie over time. We find empirical evidence for these arguments in a longitudinal study conducted among the managers of a multiunit organization. Organizational vocabularies, we suggest, may sustain communication patterns across organizational boundaries, thus bridging cultural holes within organizations."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2869," Interbank financial networks enable banks to share the risks in their assets but potentially also increase systemic spillovers of insolvency from one bank to others in the network. We model a renegotiation game to explicitly examine the forgiveness of commitments of insolvent banks by solvent banks to limit the systemic transmission of financial distress. The assets of the insolvent bank can be appropriated by the forgiving bank in the two-bank network, but not the three-bank network, where they may be appropriated by the third bank, leading to a renegotiation breakdown. We also show how banks can ex ante optimally construct networks from interbank loans and derivatives to minimize the costs of such inefficient financial distress.

/doi/10.1287/orsc.2018.1281," This paper examines how and why innovations are reshaped as they become implemented and used in locales that are distant and distinct from those where the innovation was initially developed. Drawing on an in-depth field study of the innovation process that produced a mobile money system for Kenya, we contribute an understanding of the particular dynamics that arise when an innovation trajectory interacts with local trajectories that constitute the local conditions and practices of specific places. We identify four distinct patterns of trajectory dynamics—separation, coordination, diversification, and integration—each of which has different implications for the innovation, its implementation, and consequences on the ground. Developing a model of trajectory dynamics in innovation, we theorize the processes through which innovations are transformed over time as they interact with multiple local trajectories and the specific innovation outcomes that are generated as a result. Such theorizing reconceptualizes traditional notions of innovation diffusion by explicating how and why innovations change in multiple and unexpected ways as they move to particular places and engage with local conditions and practices."
/doi/10.1287/opre.1110.0976," Delay announcements informing customers about anticipated service delays are prevalent in service-oriented systems. How delay announcements can influence customers in service systems is a complex problem that depends on both the dynamics of the underlying queueing system and on the customers' strategic behavior. We examine this problem of information communication by considering a model in which both the firm and the customers act strategically: the firm in choosing its delay announcement while anticipating customer response, and the customers in interpreting these announcements and in making the decision about when to join the system and when to balk. We characterize the equilibrium language that emerges between the service provider and her customers. The analysis of the emerging equilibria provides new and interesting insights into customer-firm information sharing. We show that even though the information provided to customers is nonverifiable, it improves the profits of the firm and the expected utility of the customers. The robustness of the results is illustrated via various extensions of the model. In particular, studying models with incomplete information on the system parameters allows us also to highlight the role of information provision in managing customer expectations regarding the congestion in the system. Further, the information could be as simple as “high congestion”/“low congestion” announcements, or it could be as detailed as the true state of the system. We also show that firms may choose to shade some of the truth by using intentional vagueness to lure customers."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0235," This paper theoretically and empirically examines the conventional wisdom in procurement management that often portrays supply inspections and supplier plant inspections as substitutes. We develop a theoretical model that focuses on potential internal spillover costs of the buyer receiving low-quality inputs and external spillover costs should low-quality inputs go undetected. Key to our analysis is the condition of whether a buyer can commit to the intensity of supply inspection. If a buyer cannot commit, supply inspections and plant inspections are substitutes, as widely believed. The two types of inspections, however, may become complements when a buyer is able to commit to the intensity of supply inspection. Complementarity is especially likely when (a) external spillovers are smaller than expected internal spillovers, which depends on the level of buffer inventory, (b) when knowledge sharing between buyer and supplier becomes more effective as the supplier allocates more resources to learning for quality improvement, or (c) when hiding aspects of the production processes is easier for suppliers. We empirically evaluate our model with a new data set drawn from a large biotechnology manufacturer. Empirical results provide broad support for theory, which, we argue, might help to explain variation in inspection practices across industries. Our theory and empirical analysis contribute to the literatures on strategic management, organizational economics, and procurement management by highlighting the organizational and strategic use of inspection practices."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2538," The recent influx of migrants and refugees into Europe and elsewhere raises questions as to whether migrant behavior reflects cultural predispositions and whether assimilation through exposure to host institutions can be expected. The paper focuses on financial behavior and uses high-quality administrative data on migrants and refugees to Sweden. It uncovers differences across cultural groups in how behavior relates to household characteristics, and shows that differences diminish with exposure to host country institutions, even for large cultural distances. Interestingly, robust cultural classification of European countries based on genetic distance or on Hofstede’s cultural dimensions fails to identify a single “southern” culture but points to a “northern” culture. Our results also have implications for the potential of European institutional harmonization, exogenously imposed during the fiscal crisis, to alleviate cultural differences in financial behavior.

/doi/10.1287/mksc.2019.1163," When salespeople with heterogeneous sales abilities are assigned into teams, how do they adjust effort as the abilities of their coworkers change? We investigate this question using a field experiment that spans 29 retail booths and 116 salespeople at a major department store in China. Each booth compensates salespeople using either an individual-based commission (IB) or a revenue-sharing (RS) incentive and employs four salespeople, with two salespeople per shift. Our field experiment randomly assigns salespeople to work shifts, thus exogenously varying the ability of a salesperson’s coworker. The results show that under the IB incentive, the lower-ability salesperson will strategically decrease effort as the ability of the coworker rises; correspondingly, the higher-ability salesperson reduces effort as the coworker’s ability decreases. In contrast, under the RS incentive, the sales pattern suggests that the lower-ability (higher-ability) salesperson increases effort when the coworker’s ability increases (decreases). These empirical results provide broad support to our theory that accounts for the effect of social preferences on salespeople’s effort decisions. We also examine the revenue implications of team composition on firm performance under different sales incentives."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2018.0786," Digital platforms can be opened in two ways to promote innovation and value generation. A platform owner can open access for third-party participants by establishing boundary resources, such as APIs and an app store, to allow complements to be developed and shared for the platform. Furthermore, to foster cooperation with the complementors, the platform owner can use an open-source license boundary resource to open and share the platform’s core resources. However, openness that is too wide renders the platform and its shared resources vulnerable to strategic exploitation. To our knowledge, platform strategies that promote such negative outcomes have remained unexplored in past research. We identify and analyze a prominent form of strategic exploitation called platform forking in which a hostile firm, i.e., a forker, bypasses the host’s controlling boundary resources and exploits the platform’s shared resources, core and complements, to create a competing platform business. We investigate platform forking on Google’s Android platform, a successful open digital platform, by analyzing the fate of five Android forks and related exploitative activities. We observe several strategies that illustrate alternative ways of bundling a platform fork from a set of host, forker, and other resources. We also scrutinize Google’s responses, which modified Android’s boundary resources to curb exploitation and retain control. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we present a theorization of the competitive advantage of open digital platforms and specifically expose platform forking as an exploitative and competitive platform strategy. Second, we extend platform governance literature by showing how boundary resources, which are mainly viewed as cooperative governance mechanisms, are also used to combat platform forking and thus sustain a platform’s competitive advantage."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2021.1460," It is well known in economics, law, and sociology that reputation costs in a closed network give insiders a feeling of being protected from bad behavior in their relations with one another. A person accustomed to doing business within a closed network is, therefore, likely to feel at unusual risk when asked to cooperate beyond the network because of absent reputation-cost security. It follows that business leaders in more closed networks should be less likely to cooperate beyond their network (Hypothesis 1 ). Success reinforces the status quo. Business leaders successful with a closed network associate their success with the safety of their network, so they should be even less likely to cooperate with a stranger (Hypothesis 2 ). We combine network data from a heterogeneous area probability survey of Chinese CEOs with a behavioral measure of cooperation to show strong empirical support for the two hypotheses. CEOs in more closed networks are less likely to cooperate beyond their network, especially those running successful businesses: successful CEOs in closed networks are particularly likely to defect against people beyond their network. The work contributes to a growing literature linking network structure with behavior: here, the closure that facilitates trust and cooperation within a network simultaneously erodes the probability of cooperation beyond the network, thereby reinforcing a social boundary around the network. Taking our results as a baseline, we close sketching new research on personality, homophily, network dynamics, and variation in the meaning of “beyond the network.”"
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2021.1451," We examine how the presence of a firm’s political connections in a candidate location affects the firm’s likelihood of choosing that location over unconnected but otherwise comparable ones to establish a new subsidiary. First, because of various benefits that political connections can generate for firms, all else equal, firms are more likely to choose the locations in which they have connections with local political leaders. Second, this effect is dampened when local economic conditions may drive local politicians to demand that connected firms engage in economically inefficient but politically desirable tasks, such as hiring superfluous labor. As a result, firms are less likely to choose a politically connected location that also suffers from higher unemployment. Moreover, this dampening effect exists (and becomes stronger) when the connected politicians hold political positions that shoulder greater responsibility for resolving local unemployment issues. Using data on all new subsidiaries established by Chinese listed firms from 2003 to 2009, we obtain empirical evidence that corroborates the hypotheses. Therefore, whether and how firms use their political connections in making location choice is strategic in that it is highly dependent on the economic and political context."
/doi/10.1287/inte.2014.0769," Achieving global polio eradication requires that global stakeholders coordinate and cooperate to invest human and financial resources in interventions that prevent virus transmission. Reaching this goal depends on effective tools and interventions, and their optimal use. Poliovirus transmission occurs in a complex global system with rapidly evolving viruses that readily cross international borders. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one of four spearheading partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), initiated a collaboration with Kid Risk, Inc. to develop and apply integrated analytical models to answer high-stakes policy questions related to managing the risks of polioviruses with consideration of human health and economic outcomes. Over the last decade, the collaboration innovatively combined numerous operations research and management science tools, including simulation, decision and risk analysis, system dynamics, and optimization to help policy makers understand and quantify the implications of their choices. These integrated modeling efforts helped motivate faster responses to polio outbreaks, leading to a global resolution and significantly reduced response time and outbreak sizes. Insights from the models also underpinned a 192-country resolution to coordinate global cessation of the use of one of the two vaccines after wild poliovirus eradication (i.e., allowing continued use of the other vaccine as desired). Finally, the model results helped us to make the economic case for a continued commitment to polio eradication by quantifying the value of prevention and showing the health and economic outcomes associated with the alternatives. The work helped to raise the billions of dollars needed to support polio eradication. The investments will prevent devastating cases of polio and realize an estimated $40–$50 billion in net benefits by the countries covered by the GPEI, while protecting the significantly larger net benefits enjoyed by the countries that stopped wild poliovirus transmission without support of the GPEI."
/doi/10.1287/stsc.2017.0031," A fundamental premise of the strategy field is the existence of persistent firm-level differences in resources and capabilities. This property of heterogeneity should express itself in a variety of empirical “signatures,” such as firm performance and arguably systematic and persistent differences in firm-level growth rates, with low cost firms outpacing high cost firms. While this property of performance differences is a robust regularity, the empirical evidence on firm growth and Gibrat’s law does not support the later conjecture. Gibrat’s law, or the “law of proportionate effect,” states that, across a population of firms and over time, firm growth at any point is, on average, proportionate to size of the firm. We develop a theoretical argument that provides a reconciliation of this apparent paradox. The model implies that in early stages of an industry history. firm growth may have a systematic component, but for much of an industry’s and firm’s history should have a random pattern consistent with the Gibrat property. The intuition is as follows. In a Cournot equilibrium, firms of better “type” (i.e., lower cost) realize a larger market share, but act with some restraint on their choice of quantity in the face of a downward sloping demand curve and recognition of their impact on the market price. If firms are subject to random firm-specific shocks, then in this equilibrium setting a population of such firms would generate a pattern of growth consistent with Gibrat’s law. However, if broader evolutionary dynamics of firm entry, and the subsequent consolidation of market share and industry shake-out is considered, then during early epochs of industry evolution, one would tend to observe systematic differences in growth rates associated with firm’s competitive fitness. Thus, it is only in these settings far from industry equilibrium that we should see systematic deviations from Gibrat’s law."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2014.0895," Consumers in many emerging markets exhibit a pronounced preference for western and global brands, while domestic brands are often associated with a cheap but low quality image. Frustrated with the negative country-of-origin (COO) stereotype imposed on them, many domestic brands from emerging markets follow a variety of approaches to disguise their COO and pretend to be foreign. This paper studies the strategic aspects of this phenomenon. We consider an experience good market where consumers learn about each brand’s quality, using its COO as a prior. Each firm can invest in product quality or COO dissociation; the former generates better quality signals while the latter simply masks the firm’s COO identity. The analysis reveals a few main insights. Sharing a reputation leads to a common good problem where firms free-ride on each other’s quality investments. As a high quality firm dissociates itself from the stereotype, it ceases to contribute to the COO image but also prevents its low quality peers from free-riding on it. This incurs a negative direct effect but a positive strategic effect on the group image. Consequently, a country’s COO image may actually improve when more high quality brands shun their identities and pretend to be foreign. In equilibrium, COO image improves monotonically as firms become more efficient in providing quality. However, the prevalence of COO dissociation may first increase then decrease. We discuss the implications of these results for emerging market brands as well as policy makers."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.1100.0594," We combine structural hole theory with performance feedback theory to identify determinants of partner selection in networks. Specifically, we examine how a brokerage position coupled with aspiration–performance gaps affects an organization's propensity to initiate ties to partners of different status. We find that organizations in brokerage positions are more likely than nonbrokers to initiate such ties systematically. However, when the performance of an organization in a brokerage position deviates from its aspirations, the organization changes its partner selection strategy and starts initiating ties to partners of similar status. Our results also suggest that organizations in brokerage positions set social and historical aspiration levels differently from nonbrokers, levels that in turn affect decisions about partner selection."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2017.0640," Using a dyadic panel data set that links U.S. suppliers with their major buyers, we study how trade credit responds to various types of competition in supply chains, as well as the impact of trade credit on firm performance. We find that suppliers with smaller market share are associated with more trade credit, confirming that suppliers with weak market power use trade credit as a competitive tool. Next, we find that buyers with larger market share are associated with more trade credit, whereas suppliers selling to a concentrated buyer base are associated with less trade credit; by differentiating competition in buyers’ markets from competition between supply chain partners, we show that the two types of competition have different impacts on trade credit. In studying the impact of trade credit on firm performance, we make the distinction between an industry-average trade credit and an individual supply chain’s deviation from such an industry average. When suppliers offer trade credit at their industry-average level, this action facilitates trade and, thus, is positively associated with both parties’ performance; conversely, when suppliers are more aggressive in their trade credit strategy than the industry average, then the excess trade credit is negatively associated with buyer performance. One managerial message from our research is that buyers should be cautious about trade credit far exceeding the industry-average level.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1120.1700," Geographic localization of knowledge spillovers is a central tenet in multiple streams of research. However, prior work has typically examined this phenomenon considering only one geographic unit—country, state, or metropolitan area—at a time and has rarely accounted for spatial distance. We disentangle these multiple effects by using a regression framework employing choice-based sampling to estimate the likelihood of citation between random patents. We find both country and state borders to have independent effects on knowledge diffusion beyond what just geographic proximity in the form of metropolitan collocation or shorter within-region distances can explain. An identification methodology comparing inventor-added and examiner-added citation patterns points to an even stronger role of political borders. The puzzling state border effect remains robust on average across analyses, though it is found to have waned with time. The country effect has, in contrast, not only remained robust but even strengthened over time. This paper was accepted by Kamalini Ramdas, entrepreneurship and innovation."
/doi/10.1287/opre.1120.1110," We consider an outsourcing problem where a group of manufacturers outsource jobs to a single third party who owns a specialized facility needed to process these jobs. The third party announces the time slots available on her facility, and the associated prices. Manufacturers reserve, on a first-come-first-book basis, time slots that they desire to utilize. Booking of overtime is possible, at a higher cost. A job completed after its due date incurs a tardiness cost. Each manufacturer books chunks of facility time and sequences his jobs over the time slots booked to minimize his booking, overtime, and tardiness costs. This model captures the main features of outsourcing operations in industries such as semiconductor manufacturing, biotechnology, and drug R&D. In current practice, the third party executes all outsourced jobs without performing optimization and coordination. We investigate the issue of the third party serving as a coordinator to create a win–win solution for all. We propose a model based on a cooperative game as follows: (i) Upon receiving the booking requests from the manufacturers, the third party derives an optimal solution if manufacturers cooperate, and computes the savings achieved. (ii) She devises a savings sharing scheme so that, in monetary terms, every manufacturer is better off to coordinate than to act independently or coalesce with a subgroup of manufacturers. (iii) For her work, the third party withholds a portion ρ of the booking revenue paid by the manufacturers for time slots that are released after coordination. We further design a truth-telling mechanism that can prevent any self-interested manufacturer from purposely reporting false job data to take advantage of the coordination scheme. Finally, we perform a computational experiment to assess the value of coordination to the various parties involved."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2542," Using two macro-based measures and one return-based measure of investment-specific technology (IST) shocks, we find that over the 1964–2012 period, exposure to IST shocks cannot explain cross-sectional return spreads based on book-to-market, momentum, asset growth, net share issues, accrual, and price-to-earnings ratio. Only one of the two macro-based measures can explain a sizable portion of the value premium over the longer 1930–2012 period. We also find that the IST risk premium estimates are sensitive to the sample period, the data frequency, the test assets, and the econometric model specification. Impulse responses of aggregate investment and consumption indicate potential measurement problems in IST proxies, which may contribute to the sensitivity of IST risk premium estimates and the failure of IST shocks to explain cross-sectional returns.

/doi/10.1287/opre.2019.1974," We study adaptive policies that handle dynamic inventory and price controls when the random demand for discrete nonperishable items is unknown. Pure inventory control is achieved by targeting newsvendor ordering quantities that correspond to empirical demand distributions learned over time. On this basis we conduct the more complex joint inventory-price control, where demand-affecting prices await to be evaluated as well. We identify policies that strive to balance between exploration and exploitation, and measure their performances via regrets, that is, the prices to pay for not knowing demand distributions a priori over a given horizon. Multiple bounds are derived on regrets’ growth rates; they vary with how thoroughly unknown the demand distributions are and whether nonperishability has indeed been accounted for. Our simulation study illustrates order-of-magnitude differences between pure inventory and joint inventory-price controls."

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.45.8.1041," United States firms collectively spend over $6.5 billion annually on coupon promotions and are becoming increasingly concerned with their profitability. FSI (free-standing-insert) data show that coupon duration varies across brands. In this paper, we show how coupon duration can affect coupon profitability. We also provide answers for some empirical observations on coupon duration. We explain, for example, why (i) coupon duration will vary across firms, such that large market share firms will give short-duration coupons and small market share firms will give long-duration coupons; (ii) longer coupon duration for one brand will increase redemption for coupons of that brand and of a competing brand; (iii) coupon duration will affect coupon profitability."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2015.0940," This paper investigates early stage “modern” grocery retail adoption in an emerging market using primary household-level panel data on grocery purchases in India’s largest city, Mumbai. Specifically, we seek insight on which socioeconomic class is more likely to adopt, and why. We model adoption as a two-stage process of modern retail choice followed by category expenditures within a shopping trip. We find a nonmonotonic (V-shaped) relationship between socioeconomic class and preferences for modern retail; specifically, modern retail spending and relative preference are greater among the upper and lower middle classes, relative to the middle middle class. Upper middle class preference of modern retail is driven by credit card acceptance, shorter store distance (relative to other segments), and higher vehicle ownership; whereas lower prices and low travel costs drive the preferences of the lower middle class. Modern retail is preferred more for branded and less for perishable categories. Interestingly, the lower middle class share of modern grocery retail’s revenues is largest, and this share is projected to grow as prices fall and store density increases. To address concerns of endogeneity and generalizability, we replicate the key results with a “conjoint” type study with exogenous variation in price and distance in two cities—Mumbai and Bangalore. We discuss implications for targeting and public policy in emerging markets."
/doi/10.1287/opre.1120.1064," We consider the problem of designing an efficient system for allocating donated livers to patients waiting for transplantation. The trade-off between medical urgency and efficiency is at the heart of the liver allocation problem. We model the transplant waiting list as a multiclass fluid model of overloaded queues, which captures the disease evolution by allowing the patients to switch between classes, i.e., health levels. We consider the bicriteria objective of minimizing total number of patient deaths while waiting for transplantation (NPDWT) and maximizing total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) through a weighted combination. On one hand, under the objective of minimizing NPDWT, the current policy of United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) emerges as the optimal policy, providing a theoretical justification for the current practice. On the other hand, under the metric of maximizing QALYs, the optimal policy is an intuitive dynamic index policy that ranks patients based on their marginal benefit from transplantation, i.e., the difference in benefit with versus without transplantation. Finally, we perform a detailed simulation study to compare the performances of our proposed policies and the current UNOS policy along the following metrics: total QALYs, NPDWT, number of patient deaths after transplantation, number of total patient deaths, and number of wasted livers. Numerical experiments show that our proposed policy for maximizing QALYs outperforms the current UNOS policy along all metrics except the NPDWT."
