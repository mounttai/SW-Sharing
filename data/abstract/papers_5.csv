/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2020.3582," We assess the impact of geographic diversification on a bank’s costs of interest-bearing liabilities. We employ a new identification strategy and discover that geographic expansion across U.S. states lowered funding costs. Consistent with expansion facilitating risk diversification, we find that (1) funding costs fall more when banks expand into states whose economies are less correlated with the banks’ state and (2) geographic diversification reduces the costs of uninsured, but not insured, deposits. Consistent with expansion intensifying agency frictions, which puts upward pressures on funding costs, we discover that geographic diversification reduces the costs of interest-bearing liabilities more in better-monitored and better-run banks.

/doi/10.1287/isre.2020.0932," Using the French antipiracy law known as HADOPI as a natural experiment, we study the asymmetric effects of online piracy on cinema admissions. Applying four estimation strategies at different levels of observation (town, movie, country, and consumer), we find that the introduction of the law is associated with a 9% increase in the market share of American movies. This increase occurs at the expense of other movies. Although we find an increase in overall admissions, this effect is not statistically significant. These findings primarily originate from a high initial level of asymmetric piracy between American and other movies, which was attenuated by the antipiracy law, resulting in a fiercer competition between movies. The results can also be explained by the behavior of younger consumers and might be caused by consumers’ budget or time constraints. We exclude positive shocks on the relative quality of American movies, the advent of three-dimensional movies, supply-side reactions by firms, and word-of-mouth effects of illegal downloads as explanations for this redistributive effect."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2836," Growing evidence shows that biological factors affect individual financial decisions that could be reflected in financial markets. Testosterone, a chemical messenger especially influential in male physiology, has been shown to affect economic decision making and is taken as a performance enhancer among some financial professionals. This is the first experimental study to test how testosterone causally affects trading and prices. We exogenously elevated testosterone in male traders and tested testosterone’s effect both on their trading behavior in experimental asset markets and on the size and duration of asset price bubbles. Using both aggregated and individual trading data, we find that testosterone administration generated larger and longer-lasting bubbles by causing high bids and the slow incorporation of the asset’s fundamental value.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2020.3684," This study investigates whether initial public offering (IPO) firms inflate “core” earnings through classification shifting (i.e., misclassifying core expenses as income-decreasing special items) immediately prior to IPOs. We provide initial evidence that IPO firms engage in classification shifting in the pre-IPO period. Using hand-collected price and share information from IPO prospectuses, we find that pre-IPO classification shifting is positively associated with a price revision from the midpoint of the initial price range to the final offer price, suggesting that pre-IPO classification shifting influences IPO price formation. Furthermore, we find that pre-IPO classification shifting is negatively associated with post-IPO stock returns. Overall, our findings caution investors, auditors, and regulators that classification shifting, a seemingly innocuous accounting maneuver, can mislead investors in their IPO valuation and is associated with post-IPO underperformance.

/doi/10.1287/msom.2018.0717," Problem definition : This study examines the effects of mobile money on the value chain, that is, mobile network operators (MNOs), banks, and end users. Mobile money is an innovative technology that is bundled with related services and is designed to provide cost-efficient financial inclusion for underserved populations in the developing world. Academic/practical relevance : By studying the interaction between mobile money value chain structures and service bundle compositions, we expand our understanding on value chain revenue allocation mechanisms in developing economies. This study provides a valuable foundation for practitioners to better coordinate the value chain and facilitate sustainable growth of mobile money services. Methodology : By combining proprietary and public data, we assess the impact of launching mobile money and the potential asymmetric effects of credit payments on the performance of the value chain. We identify control groups by using propensity score matching and estimate a quasi-experimental difference-in-difference regression. Results : We find that the launch of mobile money has had a positive effect on the performance of the value chain, consisting of old, poor, and undereducated populations. However, although some bundled, complementary services, such as credit payments, benefit participating banks, they may be associated with lower MNO profits. Moreover, the effects of mobile money on the value chain remain positive and stable over time, whereas the effects of credit payments are stronger over time. Managerial Implications : Findings suggest that MNOs and banks should be encouraged to launch mobile money and expand the customer base to old, poor, and less-educated members of the population. Certain services such as credit payment may yield asymmetric benefits such that banks could consider compensation mechanisms for the MNOs. Policy makers in developing countries should encourage coordination and promote a fair distribution of benefits between the two partners to sustain the growth of mobile money services.

/doi/10.1287/orsc.2021.1503," Effective collaboration within and between organizations requires efficient adaptation to unforeseen change. We study how parties build relational contracts that achieve this goal. We focus on the “clarity problem”—whether parties have a shared understanding of the promises they make to each other. Specifically, (a) a buyer and seller play a trading game in several periods; (b) they know their environment will change but do not know how; and (c) before any trading occurs, they can reach a nonbinding agreement about how to play the entire game. We hypothesize that pairs whose initial agreement defines a broad principle rather than a narrow rule are more successful in solving the clarity problem and in achieving efficient adaptation after unforeseen change. In our baseline condition, we indeed observe that pairs who articulate principles achieve significantly higher performance after change occurred. Underlying this correlation, we also find that pairs with principle-based agreements were more likely to both expect and take actions that were consistent with what their agreement prescribed. To investigate a causal link between principle-based agreements and performance, we implement a “nudge” intervention that induces more pairs to articulate principles. The intervention succeeds in coordinating more pairs on efficient quality immediately after the unforeseen change, but it fails to coordinate expectations on price, ultimately leading to conflicts and preventing an increase in long-run performance after the shock. Our results suggest that (1) principle-based agreements may improve organizational performance but (2) high-performing relational contracts may be difficult to build."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3427," This paper investigates the effect of exchange-traded funds’ (ETFs’) activity on the short-run informational efficiency of their underlying securities. We find that ETF activity increases short-run informational efficiency for stocks with weak information environments. The increase in informational efficiency results from the timely incorporation of systematic earnings information. In contrast, we find no such effect for stocks with stronger information environments. ETF activity increases return comovement, and this increase is partly attributable to the timely incorporation of systematic earnings information. Further, ETF activity is associated with an attenuation of postearnings-announcement drift and an increase in active share lending. This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting ."
/doi/10.1287/isre.11.2.159.11779," Previous research has demonstrated that the production of information services can be characterized at the aggregate economy-wide level by the Cobb-Douglas production function. However, the underlying production process at the firm level has not yet been ascertained. The objective of this paper is to determine the form of the production process for information systems services at the firm level by conducting an empirical analysis of IS budget data. The production of information services is modeled using a production function with two inputs, hardware and personnel. We estimate various econometric specifications to determine several characteristics of the provision of information services, including the allocation of the information systems budget to its two largest components—hardware and personnel—and its implications for the form of the production function. After controlling for industry sector, we find that the ratio of personnel to hardware is independent of scale, which indicates a homothetic production function. We also find that the ratio of factor shares is constant with time, consistent with the Cobb-Douglas production function.We conclude that the underlying form of the production function is the same at the level of both the firm and the economy. Our analysis demonstrates how the application of production theory to the production of information services can yield useful insights from both a theoretical and managerial perspective."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2015.0570," Taking advantage of the opportunities created by the price adjusted performance improvement in information technology (IT) depends in part on the ability of IT capital to substitute for other inputs in production. Studies in the information systems literature and most economics training examining the substitution of IT capital for other inputs use the Allen elasticity of substitution (AES). We present a less-well-known measure for the elasticity of substitution, the Morishima elasticity of substitution (MES). In contrast to the AES, which is misleading when there are three or more inputs—such as non-IT capital, labor, and IT capital—the MES provides a substitution measure where the scale is meaningful, and the measure differs depending on which price is changing. This is particularly important for IT capital, because prices have been declining, and there is evidence that IT capital can substitute for non-IT capital or labor in a qualitatively different way than non-IT capital and labor substitute for each other. Methodologically, we also show the impact of imposing local regularity—for example, monotonicity of output from increases in inputs—which we do through Bayesian methods employed to estimate the underlying functions that are used to calculate various measures of substitution. We demonstrate the importance of the MES as an underrecognized measure of substitution and the impact of imposing local regularity using an economy-wide industry-level data set covering 1998–2009 at the three-digit North American Industry Classification System code level. Our MES results show that reductions in the price of IT capital increase the quantity of IT capital in use, but are unlikely to change the input share of IT capital—the value of IT capital as a proportion of the value of all inputs—in contrast to major studies using the AES. In addition, estimates for both elasticities of substitution are more stable after imposing local regularity. Both of these advances—that is, the MES and imposing local regularity—have the potential to impact future work on IT productivity, IT pricing, IT cost estimation, and any type of analysis that posits the substitution of IT capital for non-IT capital or labor."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2873," We present a model of dynamic competition between two firms where firms gather customer information through first-period purchase. This creates asymmetric information in the second period whereby a firm knows more about its own past customers than its competitor does. We examine how the ability to offer personalized prices based on customer information affects prices and profit over the two periods. When product differentiation is exogenously fixed, asymmetric information leads to two asymmetric equilibria where one firm chooses more aggressive pricing to secure a larger first-period market share. When product differentiation is also chosen endogenously, there continue to exist two asymmetric equilibria where one firm chooses more aggressive positioning. The more aggressive firm, whether through pricing or positioning, can force the game to be played to its advantage. But both firms end up worse off compared to when they use simpler pricing strategies or commit to substantial product differentiation.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2018.3107," The gender difference in competitiveness has been cited as an important factor driving the gender gap in labor market outcomes. Using a field experiment with more than 35,000 university students, I explore the impact of compensation scheme on willingness to apply for a job. I find that competitive compensation schemes that depend on relative performance disproportionately deter women from applying. I do not find the same deterrence effect under a compensation scheme in which students face uncertain payoffs independent of performance. I also test the impact of describing the job as helping a charity, and this increases the willingness to apply but does not affect the gender gap. My findings are important for managers, who need to understand the impact of different compensation schemes on the share of women recruited for a job posting.

/doi/10.1287/orsc.8.1.84," An organization's decision whether or not to train its workers affects the overall economy, even if the firm does not factor the economy into its decision. If all firms within an industry fail to train their workers, the whole economy suffers. Hence, training workers is a type of public good, a category that encompasses a broad range of social dilemmas. Employees face a similar dilemma in their choice of how much to contribute to the overall productivity of the organization. If employees receive a share of the profits regardless of their contribution, some may decide to free ride on the efforts of their fellow workers. If all employees decide to do so, the company will fail. The two dilemmas on the employee and organizational levels are closely interrelated. On one side, the benefits of training accrue only to the extent that employees contribute to the organization. Thus, a firm should take into account how it expects a training program to affect employee effort as well as employee turnover. On the other side, trained workers produce at higher rates, which in turn may affect how much they contribute and how often they migrate to other firms in comparison with untrained workers. The authors study the dynamics of training and turnover in firms facing both organizational- and employee-level dilemmas. First they establish a simple model that captures those conflicts and incorporates imperfect information and both worker and organizational expectations. Organizations can be both created and dissolved, and employees can move between firms, start new ones, or leave the industry for good. Next the authors summarize the different ways the dilemmas can unfold over time, collated from a number of computer experiments. For example, under one set of conditions, the double dilemma can be resolved for the industry as a whole and productivity then increases steadily over time. Alternatively, the organizational-level dilemma may remain unresolved and workers may contribute at fluctuating levels. In that case the overall productivity stays low. The authors find a positive correlation between high productivity, low turnover, and enterprise size, a relation that has also been observed in the empirical literature on training, stability, and turnover in organizations."
/doi/10.1287/deca.1080.0124," This paper presents a decision tree model for evaluating countermeasures to reduce vulnerabilities to terrorism in commercial truck crossings at United States southwestern land ports of entry. The model includes critical events in four phases of cargo movement: cargo transfer in Mexico, Mexican customs, U.S. customs, and the inland phase. Improvements in transportation security, inspections at Mexican ports, and at U.S. ports, are comparatively evaluated using parameterized variables. Costs and benefits of such improvements are analyzed to counter a radiological dispersion device (also known as a “dirty bomb”) attack. The results suggest that security decisions depend primarily on the probability of attack and parameters that influence the overall cost of false alarms. Extensive exploratory analysis reveals that improving security at Mexican ports is not recommended, mainly due to the cost of false alarms. However, a high percentage and a high cost of false alarms may justify new radiation portal monitors at U.S. ports even when improvements in the capability to detect dangerous cargo are insignificant. Better transportation security is not recommended if the probability of attack is less than 0.15. When the probability of attack exceeds 0.15 and false-alarm related costs are high, the model recommends enhancing transportation security. In addition, the parameters modeling economic consequences of an attack in a populated area, the probability of discovering weapons after smuggling into the United States, the probability of detonation, as well as the probability of detection at U.S. ports of entry, have significant impact on the countermeasure decision."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2020.3914," We study how the menu of contracts presented to a decision maker—including contracts she may be precluded from choosing—affects her choice of remunerative but risky actions relative to lower paying, less risky alternatives. We do this through a series of laboratory experiments modeled after the loan repayment options offered to U.S. student borrowers, analyzing borrowers’ task (career) choices in settings that vary the menu of available and unavailable loan repayment plans and knowledge of unavailable options. In these experiments, we observe behavior that is inconsistent with predictions from standard economic models in which agents can easily make complex decisions and each alternative in a choice set is evaluated independently of other potential options. Instead, we provide evidence that expanding the menu of choices or making an agent aware of choices that she has been denied can affect how a contract is valued. Our empirical findings are most consistent with behavioral models that allow for anticipated regret over a choice that turns out to be suboptimal ex post or preferences for simplicity and gratitude for being unburdened from having to make a choice.

/doi/10.1287/mksc.1090.0541," This paper develops a framework for measuring “tipping”—the increase in a firm's market share dominance caused by indirect network effects. Our measure compares the expected concentration in a market to the hypothetical expected concentration that would arise in the absence of indirect network effects. In practice, this measure requires a model that can predict the counterfactual market concentration under different parameter values capturing the strength of indirect network effects. We build such a model for the case of dynamic standards competition in a market characterized by the classic hardware/software paradigm. To demonstrate its applicability, we calibrate it using demand estimates and other data from the 32/64-bit generation of video game consoles, a canonical example of standards competition with indirect network effects. In our example, we find that indirect network effects can lead to a strong, economically significant increase in market concentration. We also find important roles for beliefs on both the demand side, as consumers tend to pick the product they expect to win the standards war, and on the supply side, as firms engage in penetration pricing to invest in growing their networks."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2016.1101," We examine whether prosperous economic times have both immediate and lasting implications for corporate misconduct among chief executive officers (CEOs). Drawing on research suggesting that prosperous times are associated with excessive risk-taking, overconfidence, and more opportunities to cheat, we first propose that CEOs will be more likely to engage in corporate misconduct during good economic times. Next, we propose that CEOs who begin their careers in prosperous times will be more likely to engage in self-serving corporate misconduct later in their careers. We tested these hypotheses by assembling a large data set of American CEOs and following their stock option reporting patterns between 1996 and 2005. We found that in good economic times, CEOs were more likely to backdate their stock options grants. Moreover, CEOs who began their careers in prosperous times were more likely to backdate stock option grants later in their careers. These findings suggest that the state of the economy can influence current ethical behavior and leave a lasting imprint on the moral proclivities of new workforce entrants."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2021.4133," Using a network approach that circumvents well-known challenges in estimating peer effects, we show that interactions with a firm’s geographic neighbors play a significant causal role in corporate investment behavior and a modest role in financial policies and firm performance. Moreover, these geography network effects are almost entirely driven by propagation effects through product market and supply chain networks. We corroborate our findings in a quasi-experimental framework that allows for spillovers in treatment effects. Our findings help rationalize industrial clusters (e.g., Silicon Valley), as they illustrate that agglomeration economies are substantial and operate predominantly within industry boundaries.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2026," Databases play a central role in evidence-based innovations in business, economics, social, and health sciences. In modern business and society, there are rapidly growing demands for constructing analytically valid databases that also are secure and protect sensitive information to meet customer and public expectations, to minimize financial losses, and to comply with privacy regulations and laws. We propose new data perturbation and shuffling (DPS) procedures, named MORE, for this purpose. As compared with existing DPS methods, MORE can substantially increase the utility of secure databases without increasing disclosure risk. MORE is capable of preserving important nonmonotonic relationships among attributes, such as the inverted-U relationship between competition and innovation. Maintaining such relationships is often the key to determining optimal levels of policy and managerial interventions. MORE does not require data to be of particular types or have particular distributional shapes. Instead, it provides unified, flexible, and robust algorithms to mask general types of confidential variables with arbitrary distributions, thereby making it suitable for general-purpose data masking. Since MORE nests the commonly used generalized linear models as special cases, a much wider range of statistical analyses can be conducted by using the secure databases with results similar to those achieved by using the original databases. Unlike existing DPS approaches that typically require a joint model for all variables, MORE requires no modeling of nonconfidential variables and thus further increases the robustness of secure databases. Evaluation of MORE through Monte Carlo simulation studies and empirical applications demonstrates that it performs better than existing data-masking methods.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2020.3778," Triggered by a territorial dispute as well as historical animosity, a nationwide civilian boycott of Japanese products took place in China in the summer of 2012. Using detailed data on vehicle sales in four major Chinese cities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Nanjing), this study investigates the impact of boycotts on sales and advertising effectiveness of products from different countries of origin. The boycott dramatically reduced the market share of Japanese brands and benefitted Chinese and non-Japanese foreign brands. Consumer switching to other brands accounted for the majority of the loss in sales. Advertising became less effective for Japanese brands during the boycott but more effective for non-Japanese brands, especially at the parent-brand level (e.g., Toyota) than sub-brand level (e.g., Camry). The sales impacts were strongest in Nanjing, the city that had the most atrocious war experience with Japan during the Battle of Nanjing in 1937, and weakest in Beijing, where local government agencies explicitly discouraged public demonstrations. Finally, although the decline in sales of Japanese brands did not vary by quality or production location, competing non-Japanese brands that were had better quality or were manufactured locally benefitted more.

/doi/10.1287/isre.2020.0960," This paper uses a new microdata set of business-to-business firm-level transactions in Belgium to construct a measure of information and communication technology (ICT) investment at the firm level, which we combine with the income statement of firms to analyze the impact of ICT on productivity. We find that a firm investing an additional euro in ICT increases value added by 1 euro and 35 cents on average. This marginal product of ICT investment increases with firm size and varies across sectors. Although we find substantial returns of ICT at the firm level, such returns are much lower at the aggregate level. This is due to underinvestment in ICT (ICT capital deepening is low) and misallocation of ICT investments."
/doi/10.1287/inte.28.3.52," We carried out an analysis to determine the effect of women's relapse to high-risk sexual and needle-sharing behavior on the costs and benefits of a voluntary program to screen women of childbearing age for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. The analysis is based on a dynamic model of the HIV epidemic, combined with an economic model that assesses costs and benefits of such a program. We find that, for women with high prescreening levels of high-risk behavior, even small and short-lived reductions in sexual or needle-sharing high-risk behaviors in response to counseling and testing can produce benefits that outweigh costs. The effect of relapse to high-risk behaviors on screening program costs and benefits can be substantial, and this effect is most notable in screening programs that reach women of all risk groups. Behavioral interventions that produce sustained reductions in risk behavior could be cost saving even if the interventions were expensive."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.5.2.185," This paper is concerned with revealing and explaining patterns in the ways firms diversify into new products and industries. Shifting the focus from the observable similarity of products provided by the firm, to the less observable underlying resources required in different industries, can be a useful and interesting way of looking at patterns of diversification. The theory outlined in the paper suggests that firms diversify within groups of industries that are related to one another in the types of human skills and expertise required in each industry. Within these resource-related industry groups, firms can more efficiently utilize their resources by sharing and transferring them across similar products. The theory was tested with a sample of 12,781 diversified firms operating in all sections of the U.S. economy. Across the firms studied, much of a firm's diversification was found to be on average within resource-related industry groups and was consistent with the efficiency arguments developed. The study demonstrates the utility of looking at human expertise similarity to reveal and explain patterns in diversification. It suggests new ways of examining the concept of resources. It also suggests that the industry group, rather than the single industry, needs to be used to analyze the context where diversified firms operate. By looking at resource-related industry groups, the study encourages strategic thinking that views demand, competition, and relatedness of industries more broadly."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3423," We explore a subtle but important mechanism through which firms can control information flow to the markets. We find that firms that “cast” their conference calls by disproportionately calling on bullish analysts tend to underperform in the future. Firms that call on more favorable analysts experience more negative future earnings surprises and more future earnings restatements. A long–short portfolio that exploits this differential firm behavior earns abnormal returns of up to 149 basis points per month or almost 18% per year. We find similar evidence in an international sample of earnings call transcripts from the United Kingdom, Canada, France, and Japan. Firms with higher discretionary accruals, firms that barely meet/exceed earnings expectations, and firms (and their executives) that are about to issue equity, sell shares, and exercise options are all significantly more likely to cast their earnings calls.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0625," We study the problem of cooperative behavior emerging in an environment where individual behaviors and interaction structures coevolve. Players not only learn which strategy to adopt by imitating the strategy of the best-performing player they observe, but also choose with whom they should interact by selectively creating and/or severing ties with other players based on a myopic cost-benefit comparison. We find that scalable cooperation—that is, high levels of cooperation in large populations—can be achieved in sparse networks, assuming that individuals are able to sever ties unilaterally and that new ties can only be created with the mutual consent of both parties. Detailed examination shows that there is an important trade-off between local reinforcement and global expansion in achieving cooperation in dynamic networks. As a result, networks in which ties are costly and local structure is largely absent tend to generate higher levels of cooperation than those in which ties are made easily and friends of friends interact with high probability, where the latter result contrasts strongly with the usual intuition."
/doi/10.1287/opre.2015.1378," We study the role of local information channels in enabling coordination among strategic agents. Building on the standard finite-player global games framework, we show that the set of equilibria of a coordination game is highly sensitive to how information is locally shared among different agents. In particular, we show that the coordination game has multiple equilibria if there exists a collection of agents such that (i) they do not share a common signal with any agent outside of that collection and (ii) their information sets form an increasing sequence of nested sets. Our results thus extend the results on the uniqueness and multiplicity of equilibria beyond the well-known cases in which agents have access to purely private or public signals. We then provide a characterization of the set of equilibria as a function of the penetration of local information channels. We show that the set of equilibria shrinks as information becomes more decentralized."

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2187," Industrial production output is generally correlated with the state of the economy. Nonetheless, during times of economic downturn, some industries take the biggest hit, whereas at times of economic boom they reap most benefits. To provide insight into this phenomenon, we map supply networks of industries and firms and investigate how the supply network structure mediates the effect of economy on industry or firm sales. Previous research has shown that retail sales are correlated with the state of the economy. Since retailers source their products from other industries, the sales of their suppliers can also be correlated with the state of the economy. This correlation represents the source of systematic risk for an industry that propagates through a supply chain network. Specifically, we identify the following mechanisms that can affect the correlation between sales and the state of the economy in a supply chain network: propagation of systematic risk into production decisions, aggregation of orders from multiple customers in a supply chain network, and aggregation of orders over time. We find that the first effect does not amplify the correlation; however, the latter two intensify correlation and result in the amplification of correlation upstream in supply networks. We demonstrate three managerial implications of this phenomenon: implications for the cost of capital, for the risk-adjusted valuation of supply chain improvement projects, and for supplier selection and risk.

We find a causal treatment effect of 37 installations per municipality from the campaigns and no evidence of harvesting or persistence. The intervention also lowers installation prices. Randomized controlled trials based on the intervention show that selection into the program is important, whereas group pricing is not.

/doi/10.1287/isre.1110.0349," We investigate the incentive issues that surround the adoption and sharing of electronic health records (EHR) and the potential role of a personal health record (PHR) platform in facilitating data sharing. Through our analysis, we find evidence that health-care providers may not have an incentive to share patients' records electronically even though EHR systems will increase consumer surplus, especially in the presence of provider heterogeneity and myopic consumers. In this context, we find that an independent PHR platform can create incentives for the providers to share their patients' records electronically with other providers by selectively subsidizing them. In a pluralistic health-care system like that in the United States, where health-care providers have varying incentives to implement electronic health records, an online PHR platform can provide a proxy for a “national health information network,”' wherein consumers can freely exchange their health records among competing providers."
/doi/10.1287/serv.1120.0004," The mobile service ecosystem is in a state of fundamental and rapid transformation. Fueled by enormous revenue opportunities enabled by the emergence of smartphones, improvements in mobile network infrastructure, and an explosive global growth of and demand for mobile applications, significant changes in industry structure, collaboration, and dynamics have been observed, with new players entering the ecosystem and traditional players reshaping their roles. One new player—the mobile app store—is playing a particularly transformative role in how value is created, delivered, distributed, and consumed. This paper examines the emergence and growth of mobile app stores in the mobile service ecosystem. Based on theories of technology platforms, strategic networks, and business ecosystems, we first visualize the evolving interfirm network structure of value cocreation in the mobile service ecosystem. Second, drawing on theories of service science and the economics of digital goods, we investigate through a comprehensive field study in what ways mobile app stores are transforming value creation. Together, these two analysis perspectives provide important insights to the evolution of the mobile service ecosystem. We conclude the paper with a discussion of theoretical and managerial implications as well as future research opportunities."
/doi/10.1287/opre.2019.1912," Healthcare information exchanges (HIEs) facilitate the electronic transfer of healthcare information among healthcare organizations. Several studies have shown that HIEs have the potential of saving billions of dollars per year and significantly improving healthcare delivery. Despite this economic benefit, financial sustainability is still a key challenge for many HIEs. Even though the issue of HIE sustainability is very important, it has not been analyzed rigorously. Hence the focus of our work is to understand the operational decisions of an HIE and provide insights into making rational decisions to ensure its long-term financial sustainability. Some recent studies argue that HIEs need to provide additional services in order to improve financial sustainability. In this context, some HIEs have started partnering with external suppliers for a supplier rebate program in which each member purchases services/supplies from specific suppliers via the network and receives a fixed percentage rebate. Our model is developed for one such HIE based in Austin, Texas (Critical Connection). Although we present our model in the context of Critical Connection, we ensure that our model is generic enough to apply in other HIE settings as well. We investigate a multiperiod two-service model in which an HIE offers (1) a healthcare information-sharing service and (2) a supplier rebate program. Our proposed model is based primarily on our interactions with a number of HIE providers in Texas. First, we present structural properties and an equilibrium solution for our model. Then, based on extensive computational experiments, we present several useful managerial insights for the HIE provider (for effectively managing its network) as well as policymakers (for improving the financial sustainability of HIEs and increasing the participation of healthcare organizations in HIE networks). We also analyze a variation of our model that allows healthcare providers to self-select the types of services."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2019.0842," Problem definition : In this paper, we identify the unique challenges and trade-offs in hydro system development for developing countries and provide a supply chain perspective to expand these countries’ hydro networks for energy, irrigation, and flood control. Academic/practical relevance : The interconnected issues of water, energy, food, and flood are among the most formidable challenges faced by developing countries worldwide. The development of hydro systems has the potential to address all these issues simultaneously and thus has been prioritized in the international community to reduce poverty and promote sustainable economic development. Methodology : We develop a new integrated and dynamic modeling framework to capture the conflicts of these issues, explore the synergy among different sectors, and maximize overall benefits. The framework integrates hydro plant location and distribution decisions for both power and water; it endogenizes the budget and thus captures the dynamic interaction between water resource development and economic growth. Results : We derive analytical results in stylized models to develop general insights on the key driving forces and build a decision support model to solve large-scale problems in practice. By applying the model to the case of Pakistan, we provide solutions that outperform common practices in all aspects of energy, irrigation, and flood control. Managerial implications : Our results, both analytical and numerical, provide robust insights into the optimal development strategies on the location, sequence, and mix of hydro projects for developing countries."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1241," Economists studying innovation and technological change have made significant progress toward understanding firms' profit incentives as drivers of innovation. However, innovative performance in firms should also depend heavily on the pecuniary and nonpecuniary motives of the employees actually working in research and development. Using data on more than 1,700 Ph.D. scientists and engineers, we examine the relationships between individuals' motives (e.g., desire for intellectual challenge, income, or responsibility) and their innovative performance. We find that motives matter, but different motives have very different effects: Motives regarding intellectual challenge, independence, and money have a strong positive relationship with innovative output, whereas motives regarding job security and responsibility tend to have a negative relationship. We also explore possible mechanisms underlying the observed relationships between motives and performance. Although hours worked ( quantity of effort ) have a strong positive effect on performance, motives appear to affect innovative performance primarily via other dimensions of effort ( character of effort ). Finally, we find some evidence that the role of motives differs in upstream research versus downstream development."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2016.0682," Online communities frequently create significant economic and relational value for community participants and beyond. It is widely accepted that the underlying source of such value is the collective flow of knowledge among community participants. We distinguish the conditions for flows of tacit and explicit knowledge in online communities and advance an unconventional theoretical conjecture: Online communities give rise to tacit knowledge flows between participants. The crucial condition for these flows is not the advent of novel, digital technology as often portrayed in the literature, but instead the technology’s domestication by humanity and the sociality it affords. This conjecture holds profound implications for theory and research in the study of management and organization, as well as their relation to information technology."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2018.3060," We exploit the preemption of national banks from state laws against predatory lending by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) as a quasi-experiment to study the effect of deregulation and its interaction with competition on the supply of complex mortgages. Following the preemption ruling, national banks significantly increased their origination of loans with prepayment penalties relative to national banks in states without anti-predatory-lending laws. We highlight a competition channel: in counties where OCC-regulated lenders had larger market shares, non-OCC-regulated lenders responded by increasing their supply of contracts with riskier features, such as deferred amortization, which were not restricted by the state anti-predatory-lending law. Non-OCC lenders were able to lure borrowers into these higher-margin contracts by increasing their appeal with teaser rates. This paper was accepted by Tyler Shumway, finance."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0363," Information technology can link geographically separated people and help them locate interesting or useful resources. These attributes have the potential to bridge gaps and unite communities. Paradoxically, they also have the potential to fragment interaction and divide groups. Advances in technology can make it easier for people to spend more time on special interests and to screen out unwanted contact. Geographic boundaries can thus be supplanted by boundaries on other dimensions. This paper formally defines a precise set of measures of information integration and develops a model of individual knowledge profiles and community affiliation. These factors suggest specific conditions under which improved access, search, and screening can either integrate or fragment interaction on various dimensions. As IT capabilities continue to improve, preferences—not geography or technology—become the key determinants of community boundaries."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.1120.0773," Theories of entrepreneurship have proposed that entrepreneurs are shaped by contextual influences. This paper examines the social transmission of entrepreneurial behavior across university peers. I propose that peers acquainted at a university increase the probability of an entrepreneurial entry by transmitting information about new opportunities and by reducing the uncertainty associated with entrepreneurship. Based on unique data on hedge fund foundings between 1979 and 2006, this study documents that past entrepreneurial behaviors of university peers are an important driver of individual rates of entrepreneurship. Additional analyses show that social influence has a stronger effect on the transition to entrepreneurship when exerted by spatially proximate university peers and university peers who share gender with the focal individual. These findings provide evidence that the effect of university peers arises as a result of social influence rather than the institutional impact of universities. Together, the results uncover novel pathways of social transmission of entrepreneurship and strengthen evidence for the role of contextual influences in shaping entrepreneurial entry."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1956," Data on inventors and assignees of patents are used to analyze the mobility of semiconductor inventors. Exploiting data on the origins of semiconductor producers with larger sales, we argue that the higher mobility of semiconductor inventors in Silicon Valley is in great part due to the entry of spinoffs there. Our empirical evidence suggests that spinoff entry promoted mobility in Silicon Valley even before the industry was clustered there. Agglomeration economies and the ban on noncompete covenants may influence spinoff entry, but spinoffs promote mobility even in the absence of those conditions. Because most of the greater inventor mobility in Silicon Valley corresponds to inventors moving from incumbents to recent entrants, the benefits that arise from greater mobility rates will be disproportionately reaped by new firms.

/doi/10.1287/ited.2021.0254ca," The modeling-based case study is useful for two purposes: introduce closed-loop supply chains and highlight and model some of its unique aspects that the traditional newsvendor formulation does not capture. The case focuses on a third-party remanufacturer (3PR) who buys used cellphones in different quality grades in anticipation of demand. Phones in high grade have been used gently—they have a high acquisition cost but low remanufacturing cost. Low-grade phones have been used extensively—they are cheaper to acquire but have a higher remanufacturing cost. Medium-grade phones have intermediate acquisition and remanufacturing costs. The 3PR needs to trade off these two costs and determine which grade(s) of used phones to buy. The 3PR restores all phones to the same like-new standard during remanufacturing. Extensive use of the case in supply chain management courses shows that in the absence of a mathematical model, students systematically deviate from the optimal decisions because of contextual features. Overall, students believed the case was challenging and that it provides a valuable learning experience, both as an exposure to the closed-loop supply chain domain as well as developing models with industry-specific factors."
/doi/10.1287/inte.1.6.13," In a recent speech, Dr. Edward E. David, Jr., the U.S. President's Science Advisor, cited several examples of the successful cooperation of nations to advance, share, and apply technology to their common problems without restricting any nation's ability to compete for markets with the products of that technology. He stressed, for one example, the application of communications satellites for global point-to-point communication and, for another, sharing of computer software. I was impressed by both cases. They should serve as precedents for accelerating technological cooperation across national boundaries. Government policies concerning complicated matters require much stronger, more direct, and earlier assistance from the management science community. This is true whether we are talking about foreign trade, economic development, the management of technology, caring for our natural resources, or any other of a score of issues. Increasingly, therefore, we should be taking a management science approach as we determine how to select our national and international choices and priorities."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2018.3069," In this paper, we use mobile messaging to leverage recipients’ social ties and encourage offline prosocial activities in groups. In particular, we conduct a randomized field experiment with 80,000 blood donors and study how behavioral interventions and economic rewards motivate offline group formation. We find that two commonly used interventions—reminder messages and individual reward—are ineffective in motivating group formation because they do not compensate donors for the cost of bringing friends. In contrast, we find that group reward—a new reward that is contingent on a donor bringing a friend—is effective in motivating group formation. Furthermore, group reward tends to attract different types of donors, especially those who are traditionally less active in online social settings but have more local social ties. Structural estimation further reveals the underlying mechanisms, suggesting that group reward is four times more cost-effective than individual reward in driving total donation. Our study suggests that motivating offline group formation is a promising approach to boost prosocial activities. The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2018.3069 .

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2904," We study an economy with incomplete information in which two agents are uncertain and disagree about the length of business cycles. That is, the agents do not question whether the economy is growing or not, but instead continuously estimate how long economic cycles will last—i.e., they learn about the persistence of fundamentals. Learning about persistence generates high and persistent stock return volatility mostly during recessions, but also (to a smaller extent) during economic booms. Disagreement among agents fluctuates and earns a risk premium. A clear risk–return trade-off appears only when conditioning on the sign and magnitude of disagreement. We confirm these predictions empirically. This paper was accepted by Neng Wang, finance."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2019.1338," Little is known about when and where hybrid organizations diffuse. We argue that neo-institutional perspectives, which stress the constraining role of market categories and institutional logics, have to be complemented with demand-side perspectives that stress the enabling force of economic incentives to explain the origins of hybrids. We develop theory to predict the country-level diffusion of hybrid forms in Islamic banking in the 1975–2017 period, during which many conventional banks invaded the domain of Islamic banking by starting to sell Islamic banking services, or so-called “Islamic windows.” Our findings underscore the relevance of simultaneously studying the impact of constraining and enabling forces. Consistent with neo-institutional theory, we find strong evidence that a lack of constitutive legitimacy of the window form—only in countries where Muslims make up a large share of the population—and the ideological polarization of local audiences reify the ideological boundaries between the oppositional banking logics, which in turn hampers the diffusion of windows in the focal country. At the same time, however, it appears that the failure of local credit markets and country-level economic globalization, the latter even more in countries with a Muslim majority, provide potent economic incentives for the diffusion of windows. By stressing the role of utilitarian incentives and material exchange as drivers of hybridization, we bridge the gap between neo-institutional and more rationalist approaches of institutional change."
/doi/10.1287/trsc.2020.0984," The occurrence of unexpected aircraft maintenance tasks can produce expensive changes in an airline’s operation. When it comes to critical tasks, it might even cancel programmed flights. Despite this, the challenge of scheduling aircraft maintenance operations under uncertainty has received limited attention in the scientific literature. We study a dynamic airline maintenance scheduling problem, which daily decides the set of aircraft to maintain and the set of pending tasks to execute in each aircraft. The objective is to minimize the expected costs of expired maintenance tasks over the operating horizon. To increase flexibility and reduce costs, we integrate maintenance scheduling with tail assignment decisions. We formulate our problem as a Markov decision process and design dynamic policies based on approximate dynamic programming, including value function approximation, rolling horizon techniques, and a hybrid policy between the latter two that delivers the best results. In a case study based on LATAM airline, we show the value of dynamic optimization by testing our best policies against a simple airline decision rule and a deterministic relaxation with perfect future information. We suggest to schedule tasks requiring less resources first to increase utilization of residual maintenance capacity. Finally, we observe strong economies of scale when sharing maintenance resources between multiple airlines."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2017.1078," This paper proposes a method that makes use of firms’ mass store closures to measure the store network effects of cannibalization and density economies. I calculate each store’s contribution to chain-level profits via one-store perturbations on the set of retained stores, and map these onto the firm’s closure choices. To separate the demand- and supply-side store network effects, I exploit the fact that the business-stealing effect intensifies with local network density, whereas the supply-side disadvantage prevails at sparse regions of the network. I apply the method to study the Starbucks chain. The average rate of cannibalization imposed by a neighbor outlet is 1.2% within one mile and 0.4% within one to three miles. For remote outlets, operation costs increase by 0.3% of revenues for each mile of distance from the network. Counterfactual analyses suggest that income level is a more important determinant of demand than population count at low levels of store penetration, whereas high-population regions can sustain denser store networks because of the softening of the cannibalization effect.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3421," This paper provides evidence on the determinants and economic outcomes of updates of accounting systems (AS) over a 24-year timespan in a large sample of U.S. hospitals. We provide evidence that hospitals update their AS in response to three types of pressures: economic pressures , such as increases in the quality of accounting information driven by vendor rollouts of improved AS; coercive pressures imposed by regulators mandating certain practices, such as internal control practices imposed by Sarbanes–Oxley Section 404; and mimetic pressures for hospitals to conform their AS to those of their peers, such as local county and prominent “celebrity” peers. We find that only economically driven updates lead to economic benefits in the form of lower operating expenses and higher revenues. In contrast, we find some evidence that AS updates prompted by coercive regulatory pressures actually impose economic costs in the form of higher operating expenses.

/doi/10.1287/mksc.2017.1047," We measure the causal effects of income and wealth on the demand for private-label products. Prior research suggests that these effects are large and, in particular, that private-label demand rises during recessions. Our empirical analysis is based on a comprehensive household-level transactions database matched with price information from store-level scanner data and wealth data based on local house value indices. The Great Recession provides a key source of the variation in our data, showing a large and geographically diverse impact on household incomes over time. We estimate income and wealth effects using “within” variation of income, at the household level, and wealth, at the zip code level. Our estimates can be interpreted as income and wealth effects consistent with a consumer demand model based on utility maximization. We establish a precisely measured negative effect of income on private-label shares. The effect of wealth is negative but not precisely measured. However, the estimated effect sizes are small, by contrast to prior academic work and industry views. An examination of the possible supply-side response to the recession shows only small changes in the relative price of national-brand and private-label products. Our estimates also reveal a large positive trend in private-label shares that predates the Great Recession. We examine some possible factors underlying this trend, but find no evidence that it is systematically related to specific private-label quality tiers or to the overall rate of private-label versus national-brand product introductions.

/doi/10.1287/msom.2019.0853," Problem definition : We consider a platform that charges commission rates and subscription fees to sellers and buyers for facilitating transactions but does not directly control the transaction prices, which are endogenously determined. Buyers and sellers are divided into types, and we represent the compatibility between different types using a bipartite network. Traders are heterogeneous in terms of their valuations, and different types have possibly different value distributions. Buyers may have additional value for trading with some seller types. The platform chooses commissions/subscriptions to maximize its revenues. Academic/practical relevance : Two salient features of most online platforms are that they do not dictate the transaction prices, and they use commissions/subscriptions for extracting revenues. We shed light on how these commissions/subscriptions should be set in networked markets. Methodology : Using tools from convex optimization and combinatorial optimization, we obtain tractable methods for computing the optimal commissions/subscriptions and provide insights into the platform’s revenues, buyer/seller surplus, and welfare. Results : We provide a tractable convex optimization formulation to obtain the revenue-maximizing commissions/subscriptions, and establish that, typically, different types should be charged different commissions/subscriptions depending on their network positions. We establish that the latter result holds even when the traders on each side have identical value distributions, and in this setting we provide lower and upper bounds on the platform’s revenues in terms of the supply-demand imbalance across the network. Motivated by simpler schemes used in practice, we show that the revenue loss can be unbounded when all traders on the same side are charged the same commissions/subscriptions, and bound the revenue loss in terms of the supply-demand imbalance across the network. Charging only buyers or only sellers leads to at least half of the optimal revenues, when different types on the same side can be charged differently. Managerial implications : Our results highlight the suboptimality of commonly used payment schemes and showcase the importance of accounting for the compatibility between different user types."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.49.10.1275.17311," This begins a two-part commentary on management science and e-business, the theme of this two-part special issue. After explaining the topical clusters that give organization to both parts, we pose two key questions concerning the impact of the emerging digital economy on management science research: What fundamentally new research questions arise, and what kind of research enables progress on them. We sketch the papers appearing in this part from the perspective of both these questions, and offer summary comments on the first question based on the papers in both parts. The principal conclusion is that the digital economy is giving birth to new research questions in three main ways (not all independent): by enabling and popularizing several types of technology-mediated interactions, by spawning large-scale digital data sources, and by creating recurring operational decisions that need to be automated."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0313," We study oligopoly price competition between multiproduct firms—firms whose products interact in the profit function. Specifically, we focus on the impact of intrafirm product interactions on the level of equilibrium profits. This impact may be decomposed in two different ways: (a) a direct effect (keeping the competitors’ actions fixed) plus a strategic effect (i.e., through the competitors’ actions); or, alternatively, (b) a competitive advantage effect (change in firm i only) plus an imitation effect (change in all other firms). We derive conditions such that (a) the strategic effect more than outweighs the direct effect, and conditions such that (b) the imitation effect more than outweighs the competitive advantage effect: Bertrand supertraps . For example, an increase in the degree of economies of scope would increase profits if prices were fixed or if the change were limited to firm i ’s cost function. However, if all firms increase the degree of economies of scope then all firms receive lower profits. A variety of other applications is considered, including learning curves, core competencies, demand synergies, systems competition, compatibility, bundling, network effects, switching costs, durable goods, long-term contracts."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2018.1213," Where does generalized trust—that is, the inclination to place trust in strangers—come from? Our claim is that in economic action, sources of generalized trust may not differ much from the sources of personalized trust. Contrary to a common assumption of a sharp distinction between personalized and generalized trust, we assert a likely spillover effect from relational exchange to a person’s expectations in interacting with an anonymous other. Our research integrates behavioral measures elicited by a novel incentivized trust game with survey data using a random sample of 540 entrepreneurs of private industrial firms in the Yangzi delta region of China. We show that entrepreneurs with more experience in relational exchange display greater trust in strangers. Likewise, we find robust evidence of a positive association between beliefs in the effectiveness of community business norms and generalized trust."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.47.1.22.10667," Assembled product manufacturers often introduce line extensions that share components with existing products, or among themselves, resulting in cost interactions among products because of shared costs, and revenue interactions because of cannibalization. We present a cross-functional approach to evaluating multiple line extensions that simultaneously considers revenue implications of component sharing at the product level and cost implications at the component level . We develop a source-of-volume model and a measurement procedure to decompose the life-cycle sales volume from a line extension into sales from cannibalization, competitive draw, and demand expansion. We develop an activity-based costing procedure for estimating the life-cycle costs of line extensions that share components. We develop an optimization model that uses these revenue and cost estimates to identify a subset of line extensions that maximizes incremental profits. We implement our approach at a quartz wristwatch manufacturer. Results suggest that our approach would have improved profits for the firm by over 5%, while actually launching fewer line extensions. We also find that the drivers of cannibalization are counterintuitive. In simulation studies, our approach outperforms three managerial heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach is most valuable when cannibalization dominates competitive draw as a source of volume, and discuss its relative merits under low and high parts-sharing."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2016.1012," We test an information theory of prosocial behavior whereby ego utility and self-signaling crowd out the effect of consumption utility on choice. The data come from two field experiments involving purchases of a consumer good bundled with a charitable donation. Across experimental cells, we randomize the price level and the donation level. A model-free analysis of the data reveals nonmonotonic regions of demand when the good is bundled with relatively large charitable donations. Subjects also self-report lower ratings of “feeling good about themselves” when offered bundles with large donations and price discounts. The evidence suggests that price discounts crowd out consumer self-inference of altruism. Alternative motivation-crowding theories are rejected due to their inability to explain the nonmonotonic data moments. The standard use of interaction effects and other falsification checks to explore the underlying choice mechanism in an experimental setting is complicated in our self-signaling context. Instead, a novel feature of our analysis consists of using the experimental data to estimate the structural form of a model of consumer demand with self-signaling. We specify a model in which consumers obtain both consumption and ego utility from their choices. Ego utility derives from a consumer’s posterior self-beliefs after making her choice. An estimator is proposed that handles the potential multiplicity of equilibria that can arise in the self-signaling model. The model estimates allow us to quantify the economic role of ego utility and to explore the underlying signaling mechanism. Nested tests reject the hypothesis of no self-signaling. Alternative model specifications that potentially allow for nonmontonic demand without the self-signaling structure exhibit an inferior fit to the data. The model estimates imply that consumer response to the donations are mainly driven by ego utility and not by consumption utility (i.e., not by altruistic motives). The findings from the combination of a field experiment and a structural model contribute to a growing literature on self-signaling and consumer behavior by quantifying the magnitude of self-signaling on preferences and choices. The results also have implications for the design of a cause marketing campaign and the potential negative synergies between price and nonprice promotions.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0389," This research examines the combined influence of three causal mechanisms shaping interpersonal dynamics. Sharing a demographic characteristic has been shown to strengthen a relationship between people. The initial explanation for this positive effect emphasized the importance of individual preferences for social contact. Similar people share common interests, which makes them more attractive as exchange partners. More recent explanations have highlighted the important role of identification and competition. Identification increases the tendency for strong ties to develop among similar people, while competition reduces that tendency. I argue that tie strength is a function of all three mechanisms: a baseline level of interpersonal attraction, a positive identification effect, and a negative competition adjustment. Identification and competition vary with the number of people sharing the focal attribute to define a predictable association between sharing the focal attribute and the strength of a network connection. Predictions are tested with tenure and tie-strength data from a small research and development firm. Analysis indicates that having the same tenure has the predicted effect on communication frequency. The implications of the findings are discussed for homophily research in particular and demography research in general."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.1.3.287," This paper provides a mathematical framework for modeling demand and determining optimal price schedules in markets which have demand externalities and can sustain nonlinear pricing. These fundamental economic concepts appear in the marketplace in the form of mutual buyers' benefits and quantity discounts. The theory addressing these aspects is relevant to a wide variety of goods and services. Examples include tariffs for electronic communications services, pricing of franchises, and royalty fees for copyrighted material and patents. This paper builds on several previous results from microeconomics and extends nonlinear pricing to markets with demand externalities. The implications of this price structure are compared to results obtained for flat rates and two part tariffs in a similar context. A case study is described in which the results were applied to planning the startup of a new electronic communications service."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2925," We examine the role of teamwork within the top executive teams in generating management forecasts. Using social connections within the executive team to capture the team’s interaction, cooperation, and teamwork, we find that social connections among team members are associated with higher management forecast accuracy, consistent with economic theories that information is dispersed within a firm and with sociology insights that social connections facilitate information sharing. Further analyses show that the association between social connections and forecast accuracy is stronger when the teams are just beginning to work together, when their firms face more uncertainty or adversity, and when the CEOs are less powerful. Our results hold for a subsample of executive teams that experience pseudo exogenous shocks to their social connectedness. Taken together, our results underscore the importance of teamwork among executives in the forecast generation process. This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting."
/doi/10.1287/isre.1080.0223," Outsourcing of software development allows a business to focus on its core competency and take advantage of vendors' technical expertise, economies of scale and scope, and their ability to smooth labor demand fluctuations across several clients. However, contracting a software project to an outside developer is often quite challenging because of information asymmetry and incentive divergence. A typical software development contract must deal with a variety of interrelated issues such as the quality of the developed system, the timeliness of delivery, the effort and cost associated with the project, the contract payment, and the postdelivery software support. This paper presents a contract-theoretic model that incorporates these factors to analyze how software outsourcing contracts can be designed. We find that despite their relative inefficiency, fixed-price contracts are often appropriate for simple software projects that require short development time. Time-and-materials contracts work well for more complex projects when the auditing process is efficient and effective. We also examine a type of performance-based contract called quality-level agreement and find that the first-best solution can be reached with such a contract. Finally, we consider profit-sharing contracts that are useful in situations where the developer has more bargaining power."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2015.0571," Software as a Service (SaaS) delivers a bundle of applications and services through the Web. Its on-demand feature allows users to enjoy full scalability and to handle possible demand fluctuations at no risk. In recent years, SaaS has become an appealing alternative to purchasing, installing, and maintaining modifiable off-the-shelf (MOTS) software packages. We present a game-theoretical model to study the competitive dynamics between the SaaS provider, who charges a variable per-transaction fee, and the traditional MOTS provider. We characterize the equilibrium conditions under which the two coexist in a competitive market and those under which each provider will fail and exit the market. Decreasing the lack-of-fit (or the cross-application data integration) costs of SaaS results in four structural regimes in the market. These are MOTS Dominance → Segmented Market → Competitive Market → SaaS Dominance. Based on our findings, we recommend distinct competitive strategies for each provider. We suggest that the SaaS provider should invest in reducing both its lack-of-fit costs and its per-transaction price so that it can offer increasing economies of scale. The MOTS provider, by contrast, should not resort to a price-cutting strategy; rather, it should enhance software functionality and features to deliver superior value. We further examine this problem from the software life-cycle perspective, with multiple stages over which users can depreciate the fixed costs of installing and customizing their MOTS solutions on site. We then present an analysis that characterizes the competitive outcomes when future technological developments could change the relative levels of the lack-of-fit costs. Specifically, we explain why the SaaS provider will always use a forward-looking pricing strategy: When lack-of-fit costs are expected to decrease (increase) in the future, the SaaS provider should reduce (increase) its current price. This is in contrast with the MOTS provider, who will use the forward-looking pricing strategy only when lack-of-fit costs are expected to increase. Surprisingly, when such costs are expected to decrease, the MOTS provider should ignore this expectation and use the same pricing strategy as in the benchmark with invariant lack-of-fit costs."
/doi/10.1287/isre.1050.0055," Growth of Web-based applications has drawn a great number of diverse stakeholders and specialists into the information systems development (ISD) practice. Marketing, strategy, and graphic design professionals have joined technical developers, business managers, and users in the development of Web-based applications. Often, these specialists work for different organizations with distinct histories and cultures. A longitudinal, qualitative field study of a Web-based application development project was undertaken to develop an in-depth understanding of the collaborative practices that unfold among diverse professionals on ISD projects. The paper proposes that multiparty collaborative practice can be understood as constituting a “collective reflection-in-action” cycle through which an information systems (IS) design emerges as a result of agents producing, sharing, and reflecting on explicit objects. Depending on their control over the various economic and cultural (intellectual) resources brought to the project and developed on the project, agents influence the design in distinctive ways. They use this control to either “add to,” “ignore,” or “challenge” the work produced by others. Which of these modes of collective reflection-in-action are enacted on the project influences whose expertise will be reflected in the final design. Implications for the study of boundary objects, multiparty collaboration, and organizational learning in contemporary ISD are drawn."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2060," We propose and test a view of corporate diversification as a strategy that exploits internal information markets, by bringing together information that is scattered across the economy. First, we construct an interindustry network using input-output data, to proxy for the economy’s information structure. Second, we introduce a new measure of conglomerate informational advantage, named “excess centrality,” which captures how much more central conglomerates are relative to specialized firms operating in the same industries. We find that high-excess-centrality conglomerates have greater value, and produce more and better patents. Consistent with the internal-information-markets view, we also show that excess centrality has a greater effect in industries covered by fewer analysts and in industries where soft information is important.

/doi/10.1287/opre.1090.0737," We consider a number of servers that may improve the efficiency of the system by pooling their service capacities to serve the union of the individual streams of customers. This economies-of-scope phenomenon is due to the reduction in the steady-state mean total number of customers in the system. The question we pose is how the servers should split among themselves the cost of the pooled system. When the individual incoming streams of customers form Poisson processes and individual service times are exponential, we define a transferable utility cooperative game in which the cost of a coalition is the mean number of customers (or jobs) in the pooled system. We show that, despite the characteristic function is neither monotone nor concave, the game and its subgames possess nonempty cores. In other words, for any subset of servers there exist cost-sharing allocations under which no partial subset can take advantage by breaking away and forming a separate coalition. We give an explicit expression for all (infinitely many) nonnegative core cost allocations of this game. Finally, we show that, except for the case where all individual servers have the same cost, there exist infinitely many core allocations with negative entries, and we show how to construct a convex subset of the core where at least one server is being paid to join the grand coalition."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2016.1073," This article sheds light on the ongoing employment stagnation in the United States by investigating the links between the rise of finance and firm employment dynamics during the 1982–2005 period. I argue that the rise of finance marginalized the role of labor in revenue generating and sharing processes, which led to employment stagnation among the largest nonfinancial firms in the United States. Evidence suggests that increasing investment in financial assets depresses the workforce size. The growing dependence on debt reprioritizes the order of distribution, heightening the need for workforce reduction. The increasing rewards for shareholders generate a downsize-and-distribute spiral, in which labor expense becomes a primary target of cost-cutting strategies. Further analysis indicates that production and service workers are more vulnerable to shifts associated with the rise of finance than managers and professionals."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.1060.0216," In this paper we characterize the impact of production technology on the optimal product line design. We analyze a problem in which a manufacturer segments the market on quality attributes and offers products that are partial substitutes. Because consumers self-select from the product line, product cannibalization is an issue. In addition, the manufacturer sets a production schedule in order to balance production setups with accumulation of inventories in the presence of economies of scale. We show that simultaneous optimization of the product line design and production schedule leads to insights that differ significantly from the common intuition and assertions in the literature, which omits either the demand side or the supply side of the equation. In particular, we demonstrate that more expensive production technology always leads to lower product prices and may at the same time lead to higher quality products. Further, a less efficient production technology does not necessarily increase total production costs or reduce consumer welfare. We also demonstrate that in the presence of production technology, the demand cannibalization problem may distort product quality upward or the number of products upward, which is contrary to the standard result."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1733," Competitive Incentives: Working Harder or Working Smarter? (p. 771) Anat Bracha, Chaim Fershtman Can we design work incentives to spur employees to work both harder and smarter? Almost all jobs require a combination of cognitive effort and labor effort. The authors examine the effect that incentive schemes have on the chosen combination of cognitive and labor effort. They show that competitive incentives may induce agents to work harder but not necessarily smarter. The insight for management: It is difficult to think under pressure, and therefore competitive pressure has a negative impact on cognitive effort but a positive impact on labor effort. Analyzing Screening Policies for Childhood Obesity (p. 782) Yan Yang, Jeremy D. Goldhaber-Fiebert, Lawrence M. Wein What can be done about obesity? Because of the health and economic costs of childhood obesity, coupled with studies suggesting the benefits of comprehensive intervention (dietary changes, physical activity, and behavioral counseling), the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended childhood screening and intervention for obesity beginning at age 6. The authors use a data set consisting of the body mass index of children up to age 18 and another data set containing the body mass index at ages 18 and 40 with the presence or absence of hypertension and diabetes to formulate the optimal biennial obesity screening thresholds from a societal viewpoint. The insight for management: Adult hypertension and diabetes can be minimized by focusing childhood obesity screening and treatment on older adolescents, but the optimal childhood obesity screening policies are as yet unclear. Class-Restricted Clustering and Microperturbation for Data Privacy  (p. 796) Xiao-Bai Li, Sumit Sarkar How can businesses leverage the plethora of data now available without threatening the privacy of their customers? The extensive use of information technologies by organizations to collect and share personal data has raised strong privacy concerns. For example, AOL drew fire for releasing 20 million search queries to the public, and Netflix had to cancel the second round of its movie recommendation competition because its customers were concerned about their privacy and being “reidentified”—that is, individually identified even though the personal information was stripped. The authors propose a method of clustering data so that data points within a group are similar in the nonconfidential attribute values, whereas the confidential attribute values within a group are well distributed. They also propose a “microperturbation” method for masking data that overcomes other clustering methods' inability to preserve important statistical properties such as the variance of attributes and the covariance across attributes. The insight for management: It is possible to distribute and gain insights from data without threatening the privacy of those who generated it by masking private details without reducing the information that can be gleaned from it. Managing Strategic Inventories via Manufacturer-to-Consumer Rebates  (p. 813) Anil Arya, Brian Mittendorf Do you clip coupons? In 2011, coupons alone accounted for $4.6 billion in consumer redemptions, and it is estimated that other postpurchase rebates have soared to $8 billion annually. Manufacturer-to-consumer rebates are a staple of modern supply chains. Such rebates are typically viewed as a means of price discrimination because of partial redemption by consumers. However, the proliferation of universally redeemed instant rebates suggests that the practice may be motivated by additional considerations. The authors suggest that consumer rebates can be particularly useful when a supply chain shows inefficiencies from retailers holding excess inventory to convey a lower willingness to pay in the future to undercut future wholesale prices. As a retaliatory consequence, the manufacturer sets high near-term wholesale prices. The “pull” promotion from consumer rebates encourages more timely retail sales and in doing so undercuts (but does not eliminate) the retailer's strategic inventories. Surprisingly, the authors find that the manufacturer, retailer, and consumers alike all benefit from the use of rebates, despite the fact that the manufacturer uses the rebates in self-interest and as a strategic weapon. The insight for management: The introduction of consumer rebates can serve as an enticement for retailers to sell, not just for consumers to buy. Overcoming Resistance to Organizational Change: Strong Ties and Affective Cooptation (p. 819) Julie Battilana, Tiziana Casciaro Keep your friends close and your enemies closer! The authors develop a theory of how members of an organization use the strength of ties in their network to overcome resistance to change. The authors propose that potentially influential “fence sitters” can be affected by strong ties to change agents. This cooptation increases the probability that the organization will adopt the change. However, ties to influential organization resistors to change work only for small changes. With bigger changes, the advantages of strong ties to resistors are weaker and may turn into liabilities that reduce the likelihood of change adoption. The insight for management: Team with resistors to stop a leak but not a tidal wave; team with change agents to create one. Knowledge Recombination Across Technological Boundaries: Scientists vs. Engineers (p. 837) Marc Gruber, Dietmar Harhoff, Karin Hoisl How do individual-level characteristics of inventors affect the breadth of their recombination of different technologies to generate radical innovations? This ability has been viewed as the “holy grail” of innovation research for a century. The authors reviewed 30,550 European patents from 1,880 inventors and found that inventors with a scientific education are more likely to generate patents that span technological boundaries than those with an engineering degree, but a doctoral degree is  associated with increased recombination breadth. The breadth of an inventor's technological recombinations diminishes with time since his formal education, but the differences between scientists and engineers persist over time. The insight for management: Broader and deeper education of inventors leads to broader creativity and recombination of ideas than a narrower engineering degree. Momentum and Organizational Risk Taking: Evidence from the National Football League (p. 852) David W. Lehman, Jungpil Hahn Does going for it on fourth down build momentum, or is the risk unwarranted? The authors reviewed 22,603 play-by-play decisions made by the 32 teams of the National Football League during the 2000–2005 regular season games. They evaluate how such risks affect slack (resources in excess of current performance), aspirations (based on past performance or on the performance of other organizations), and survival. Most importantly, such risk-taking behaviors seem to be affected by momentum. The insight for management: Risk taking builds on itself; better forecasts of future firm behaviors might be achieved by taking momentum into account. Multistage Capital Budgeting with Delayed Consumption of Slack (p. 869) Stanley Baiman, Mirko S. Heinle, Richard Saouma How can a firm's capital budgeting policies balance investment efficiency against managers' consumption of perquisites? To limit the opportunities for managers to divert capital funds for private benefit, firms use their managerial accounting systems and audits of their capital projects. For example, these systems can easily uncover, and thereby preclude, the manager's diversion of capital funds from appropriate investments to private uses such as vacations or excess compensation. However, it is more difficult for these systems to distinguish between investments in necessary and unnecessary assets, provided that both fall within the general class of appropriate purchases. For instance, it may be difficult to detect that a manager is engaging in empire building (acquiring unnecessary hard assets such as research equipment, cars, or offices, or unnecessary soft assets such as staff and consulting services) from which he derives private benefits. Thus, at best the firm's accounting and auditing systems may mitigate a manager's misuse by constraining the set of assets into which he can divert capital funds for private benefit. For example, the private benefit of lavish offices is consumed over the time that the manager actually uses these offices (as compared to excess compensation or vacations, whose benefits are consumed immediately). The insight for management: Restricting investment to specific asset classes can reduce the private benefit to the manager to those consumed over time. Failure and Rescue in an Interbank Network (p. 882) L. C. G. Rogers, L. A. M. Veraart How do interbank obligations affect the fragility of our financial system? Over the last 10 or so years, there has been a growth of interest in the general phenomenon of the spread of bank failure through a network of interbank obligations. As the Asian banking crisis of the late 1990s and the more recent banking crisis of 2007–2008 have shown, the banking system generally can be very vulnerable to deterioration of assets, loss of liquidity, and loss of confidence. The authors study systemic risk in an interbank market, modeled as a directed graph of interbank obligations. The authors are able to analyze how failing banks might be rescued by consortia of other banks, establishing the important results that any consortium that has an incentive to rescue the failing banks also has the means and that any consortium of banks that would fail if default were allowed to spread would have an incentive to rescue if it had the means. The insight for management: Modeling may allow for reduced risks in and improved rescue mechanisms for our financial system. Add-on Pricing by Asymmetric Firms (p. 899) Jeffrey D. Shulman, Xianjun Geng What is the effect of add-on pricing on profitability and customer satisfaction? Consumers are often faced with fees for add-ons not included in the price of a base product (or service). For example, hotel guests, after room rates are already paid, often have to pay additional charges for services such as Internet access, parking, and use of a safe, a fitness center, and a pool. Banks charge fees for consumers who opt to cancel a check, use a foreign ATM, or use a debit card. Air travelers frequently find themselves paying for pet transport, snacks, checked luggage, and even blankets. Cell phone service providers charge subscribers to send text messages and download data. The authors examine the consequences of add-on pricing with consumers who are unaware of the add-on fees at the time of initial purchase. As it turns out, who benefits depends on the knowledge of the quality of the base product and the add-on items. The insight for management: Before a firm engages in add-on pricing strategies, it should evaluate the quality of base and add-on products. Publicizing Performance (p. 918) Günter Strobl, Edward D. Van Wesep Why not hide employee success from competitors to reduce poaching? Firms often do not attempt to keep their best employees hidden. Indeed, they often do just the opposite, by giving good employees impressive-sounding job titles and awards and, if asked, providing good letters of recommendation. This behavior is puzzling, because it makes it easier for competitors to poach a firm's best employees. As it turns out, firms that establish reputations for hiring young workers and promoting those who succeed lose good workers to competitors but can pay less to young, inexperienced workers in exchange. The authors find that firms with reputations for publicizing performance are able to pay less to employees at every level of tenure and thus earn economic profit but that these firms will never be the most productive in the economy. The insight for management: Public celebration of employee success may risk poaching and higher turnover, but the in-kind payment may also allow for the firm to pay lower employee wages. First-Party Content and Coordination in Two-Sided Markets (p. 933) Andrei Hagiu, Daniel Spulber Bill Gates said, “Content is king.” This statement rings true because many firms use content as in-kind payments to attract customers. But how should this content be coordinated? The software, Internet, and mobile communications revolutions have created information distribution systems of unprecedented efficiency and vast markets for content (e.g., news, entertainment, data, software applications, games, articles, books, music, images, and video). Examples of platforms supplying first-party content include the following: e-commerce sites (e.g., Amazon) provide customer ratings, search engines (e.g., Google) provide search results (website links), social networks (e.g., Facebook) provide network information (friend suggestions), and the like. The authors find that the strategic use of first-party content by two-sided platforms is driven by two key factors: the nature of buyer and seller expectations (favorable versus unfavorable) and the nature of the relationship between first-party content and third-party content (complements or substitutes). The insight for management: Coordinating first- and third-party content depends on the market for such products and the complementarity of first- and third-party products. Industry or Academia, Basic or Applied? Career Choices and Earnings Trajectories of Scientists (p. 950) Rajshree Agarwal, Atsushi Ohyama They say, “Different strokes for different folks,” but what factors drive career choices and earnings trajectories? Many studies have looked at earnings potential of different career choices, but few have looked at the individual factors that contribute to career choice and the resulting self-sorting and earnings evolution. The authors link differences in physical capital investments and complementarities between basic and applied scientists across industry and academic settings to individual differences in scientist ability and preferences to predict an equilibrium matching of scientists to careers and to their earnings evolution. The study, based on the National Science Foundation's Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System database, finds two results. First, there is a sorting by ability into basic versus applied science among academic scientists, but not among industry scientists. Second, there is a sorting by higher taste for nonmonetary returns into academia over industry. The evolution of an earnings profile is consistent with these sorting patterns: The earnings trajectories of basic and applied scientists are distinct from each other in academia but are similar in industry. The insight for management: There is a natural sorting by individual preference into theoretical and applied sciences and into industry and academia that drives earnings trajectories. Competitive Price-Matching Guarantees: Equilibrium Analysis of the Availability Verification Clause Under Demand Uncertainty (p. 971) Arcan Nalca, Tamer Boyaci, Saibal Ray, Many advertisers claim, “No lower prices, anywhere!” But what value is the claim if the shopper has the onus of proving the claim wrong? Price-matching guarantees involve a retailer matching the lower price of a competitor for an identical product. In reality, retailers often make such guarantees contingent on the verification of product availability at the competitor's location and decline a price-match request if the product is not available there. This creates certain consternation on the part of customers. The authors show that availability contingency clauses intensify inventory competition between retailers and reinstitute price competition, which is otherwise eliminated by unconditional price-matching guarantees. Consequently, despite what customers may think about the availability verification, it actually makes them better off. On the other hand, such a clause reduces profits and, hence, is not an ideal strategy for retailers. The insight for management: Availability contingency clauses on price guarantees sound like a safeguard for retailers, but, in fact, they reduce prices and increase inventory availability competition, making retailers worse off and consumers better off. Mechanism Design for Capacity Planning Under Dynamic Evolutions of Asymmetric Demand Forecasts (p. 987) Sechan Oh, Özalp Özer Should a supplier build its capacity to meet manufacturer forecasts? Forecast information sharing has been touted as a great value toward increasing the efficiency of supply chains. But these forecasts must be accurate and unbiased to be useful. The authors consider a supplier's problem of eliciting credible forecast information from a manufacturer. The supplier uses demand information to better plan for a capacity investment decision. When the supplier postpones building capacity and screening the manufacturer's private information, the supplier and the manufacturer can obtain more information and update their forecasts. This delay, however, may increase the degree of information asymmetry between the two firms, resulting in a higher cost of screening. The capacity building cost may also increase because of a tighter deadline for building capacity. The insight for management: This paper shows the supplier (i) when to stop obtaining new demand information and build capacity, (ii) whether to offer a screening contract to credibly elicit private forecast information or to determine the capacity level without information sharing, (iii) how much capacity to build, and (iv) how to design the overall mechanism so that both firms benefit from this mechanism."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2021.4017," Why do some leaders use praise as a means to motivate workers, whereas other leaders use social punishment? This paper develops a simple economic model to examine how leadership styles depend on the prevailing labor market conditions for workers. We show that the existence of a binding wage floor for workers (e.g., due to trade union wage bargaining, minimum wage legislation, or limited-liability protection) can make it attractive for firms to hire a leader who makes use of social punishment. Although the use of social punishments generally is socially inefficient, it lessens the need for high bonus pay, which allows the firm to extract rents from the worker. In contrast, firms hire leaders who provide praise to workers only if it is socially efficient to do so. Credible use of leadership styles requires either repeated interaction or a leader with the right social preferences. In a single-period setting, only moderately altruistic leaders use praise as a motivation tool, whereas only moderately spiteful leaders use social punishment. Lastly, we show that when the leaders’ and workers’ reservation utilities give rise to a bigger income gap between leaders and workers, attracting spiteful leaders becomes relatively less costly and unfriendly leadership becomes more prevalent. This paper was accepted by Axel Ockenfels, behavioral economics and decision analysis."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.1030.0054," We contend that two important, nonrelational, features of formal interorganizational networks—geographic propinquity and organizational form—fundamentally alter the flow of information through a network. Within regional economies, contractual linkages among physically proximate organizations represent relatively transparent channels for information transfer because they are embedded in an ecology rich in informal and labor market transmission mechanisms. Similarly, we argue that the spillovers that result from proprietary alliances are a function of the institutional commitments and practices of members of the network. When the dominant nodes in an innovation network are committed to open regimes of information disclosure, the entire structure is characterized by less tightly monitored ties. The relative accessibility of knowledge transferred through contractual linkages to organizations determines whether innovation benefits accrue broadly to membership in a coherent network component or narrowly to centrality. We draw on novel network visualization methods and conditional fixed effects negative binomial regressions to test these arguments for human therapeutic biotechnology firms located in the Boston metropolitan area."
/doi/10.1287/opre.2019.1939," Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), most famously used in game-play artificial intelligence (e.g., the game of Go), is a well-known strategy for constructing approximate solutions to sequential decision problems. Its primary innovation is the use of a heuristic, known as a default policy , to obtain Monte Carlo estimates of downstream values for states in a decision tree. This information is used to iteratively expand the tree toward regions of states and actions that an optimal policy might visit. However, to guarantee convergence to the optimal action, MCTS requires the entire tree to be expanded asymptotically. In this paper, we propose a new “optimistic” tree search technique called primal-dual MCTS that uses sampled information relaxation upper bounds on potential actions to make tree expansion decisions, creating the possibility of ignoring parts of the tree that stem from highly suboptimal choices. The core contribution of this paper is to prove that despite converging to a partial decision tree in the limit, the recommended action from primal-dual MCTS is optimal. The new approach shows promise when used to optimize the behavior of a single driver navigating a graph while operating on a ride-sharing platform. Numerical experiments on a real data set of taxi trips in New Jersey suggest that primal-dual MCTS improves on standard MCTS (upper confidence trees) and other policies while exhibiting a reduced sensitivity to the size of the action space."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2020.1378," Organizations often learn vicariously by observing what other organizations do. Our study examines vicarious learning–related communication through which individuals share their observations with other organizational members. Most students and members of present-day organizations would expect that this communication is driven by a prodevelopment logic—that communication serves the purpose of organizational improvement and competitiveness. Our unique historical evidence on learning-related communication over multiple decades shows that the subjective and collective attitude toward prodevelopment communication may be ideologically conditioned. Prodevelopment communication is the norm in capitalist organizations, but competing ideologies may emphasize other goals higher than organizational development. Consequently, increasing challenges to capitalism as the ideological basis of economic organization can have deep impacts on how organizations learn and produce innovations in the future."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2020.1261," Online vendors often employ drip-pricing strategies, where mandatory fees are displayed at a later stage in the purchase process than base prices. We analyze a large-scale field experiment on StubHub.com and show that disclosing fees upfront reduces both the quantity and quality of purchases. The effect of salience on quality accounts for at least 28% of the overall revenue decline. Detailed click-stream data show that price shrouding makes price comparisons difficult and results in consumers spending more than they would otherwise. We also find that sellers respond to increased price obfuscation by listing higher-quality tickets."
/doi/10.1287/deca.2017.0345," Near-miss experiences have been identified as a contributing factor in responses to risk of disaster events. Researchers have found that specific characteristics of a near-miss event could lead individuals to interpret the risk as either “vulnerable” or “resilient.” Moreover, these interpretations can lead to quite different decisions regarding future protective behavior. We developed the Near-Miss Appraisal Scale (NMAS) to assess an individual’s tendency to interpret near misses as vulnerable (or resilient). We developed an initial item pool of 21 items and recruited a sample of 298 respondents through Amazon Mechanical Turk. The final version of the NMAS is based on 10 of these items, following psychometric analysis for dimensionality, scale reliability, and item functioning. We establish discriminant validity of the NMAS by correlating the NMAS with scales of locus of control and risk taking, and predictive validity by using the NMAS to predict individual responses to a near-miss disaster scenario. The current study demonstrates that responses to near misses are not only determined by the nature of the event itself, but also related to decision makers' near-miss appraisal tendencies."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2017.0679," With supply chains now extending into developing countries, time and again, working conditions in supplier factories have been found to be unsafe. In this study, we focus on factories in the Bangladesh ready-made garment industry that supplies North American and European retailers. These retailers have adopted an innovative approach toward improving the working conditions of supplier factories by forming consortiums. The consortium of North American retailers is the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety (“Alliance”). The consortium of European retailers is the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh (“Accord”). The central question addressed in this study is the following: How do working conditions in a supplier factory impact the supplier’s trustworthiness from a retailer’s perspective? We characterize supplier factory working conditions in terms of three types of risks, namely, structural risk, fire risk, and electrical risk. Next, we examine the implications of each type of risk for supplier trustworthiness measured as the number of retailers contracting with the supplier factory. The empirical analysis is conducted using archival data on safety inspections from the Alliance and Accord. The results support the contention that retailers are sensitive to working condition risks in a supplier factory; that is, as working condition risks in a supplier factory increase, the supplier’s trustworthiness decreases. However, these associations vary with the type of risk. Specifically, fire and electrical risks are associated with decreased supplier trustworthiness, while structural risk has a marginal effect. Furthermore, the negative associations between working condition risks and supplier trustworthiness are moderated by the size of the supplier factory such that the negative associations are significantly attenuated for larger-sized supplier factories compared to the smaller-sized factories. The study findings, taken together, provide nuanced insights into the marketplace implications of working condition risks in supplier factories and highlight the sensitivity of the retailer–supplier relationship to such risks. These findings also provide actionable guidance on how to manage working condition risks. The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2017.0679 .

/doi/10.1287/orsc.1100.0592," This paper explores the interplay between social structure and economic action by examining some of the evolutionary dynamics of an emergent network that coalesces into a small-world system. The study highlights the small-world system's evolutionary dynamics at both the macro level of the network and the micro level of an individual actor. This dual analytical lens helps establish that, in competitive and information-intensive settings, a small-world system could be a highly dynamic structure that follows an inverted U-shaped evolutionary pattern, wherein an increase in the small-worldliness of the system is followed by its later decline as a result of three factors: (1) the recursive relationship between the evolving social structure and individual actors' formation of bridging ties, which eventually homogenizes the information space and decreases actors' propensity to form bridging ties, creating a globally separated network; (2) self-containment of the small-world network, or increasing homogenization of the social system, which makes the small world less accepting of and less attractive to new actors, thereby limiting formation of bridging ties to outside clusters; and (3) fragmentation of the small-world network, or the small-world system's inability to retain current clusters. The study uses data on interorganizational tie formation in the global computer industry in the period from 1996 to 2005 to test the hypothesized relationships."

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2223," The multibillion-dollar online advertising industry continues to debate whether to use the cost per click (CPC) or cost per action (CPA) pricing model as an industry standard. This paper applies the economic framework of incentive contracts to study how these pricing models can lead to risk sharing between the publisher and the advertiser and incentivize them to make efforts that improve the performance of online ads. We find that, compared with the CPC model, the CPA model can better incentivize the publisher to make efforts that can improve the purchase rate. However, the CPA model can cause an adverse selection problem: the winning advertiser tends to have a lower profit margin under the CPA model than under the CPC model. We identify the conditions under which the CPA model leads to higher publisher (or advertiser) payoffs than the CPC model. Whether publishers (or advertisers) prefer the CPA model over the CPC model depends on the advertisers’ risk aversion, uncertainty in the product market, and the presence of advertisers with low immediate sales ratios. Our findings indicate a conflict of interest between publishers and advertisers in their preferences for these two pricing models. We further consider which pricing model offers greater social welfare. This paper was accepted by J. Miguel Villas-Boas, marketing ."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2021.4007," We study the effects of village credit information sharing on individual microloan repayment, using a randomized experiment with loan applicants from 40 villages in rural China. In our main treatment, customers received a message on the loan application form that “overdue payment (40 days after each installment due date) will be considered for public disclosure among the village by showing debtors’ names on a blackboard outside the village office of the microlending institution.” On average, this social appeal reduces the share of delinquents and the individual delinquency rate by 18.6% and 5.6% from baseline rates of 79.5% and 15.2%, respectively. The effects appear more pronounced among male and older borrowers. Additional treatments help to benchmark the effect against lender credit information sharing and separate the effects on adverse selection and moral hazard. Mechanism analysis shows that the publicly disclosed “blacklist” of delinquents affects borrowers’ repayment behaviors, partially through borrowers’ fear of losing informal risk insurance from the village society and predominately through public shaming penalties. Overall, these results support that, in traditional societies, social appeals can provide not only pecuniary, but also psychological incentives to improve loan repayment. Psychological incentives, to some extent, have stronger effects."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2018.3117," This paper studies the effect of introducing a new vertical differentiation strategy, paying for an upgrade to a premium product after purchasing the base product, on the price dispersion of the base product arising from existing price discrimination strategies. In particular, we examine how a major U.S. airline’s price dispersion in the coach cabin changes after introducing the option to upgrade to a new type of premium economy seating within the coach cabin. We first provide a theoretical analysis that highlights two competing pressures that the new premium economy seating upgrades created on coach class prices. On the one hand, the airline benefits from lowering its prices because by allowing more customers to purchase in the first place, it increases the probability of selling upgrades (admission effect). On the other hand, for some customers, the value of flying with the airline increases because of the upgrade availability, therefore the airline may find it optimal to increase its prices (valuation effect). In the second part of the paper, we conduct an empirical investigation of the impact of upgrade introduction on coach class prices, based on a proprietary transaction-level data set from a major U.S. airline company. The empirical analysis tests the main predictions of our theoretical model and examines further nuances. The results show that the introduction of the premium economy seating upgrades is associated with an increase in the price dispersion and revenues in the coach class, the admission effect is stronger than the valuation effect on the low end of the price distribution, and the opposite is true on the high end of the price distribution. Finally, we discuss implications of our results for firm revenues and consumer welfare. This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.49.11.1445.20579," This concludes a two-part commentary on management science and e-business, the theme of this two-part special issue. After reviewing the topical clusters that give organization to both parts, we sketch the papers appearing in this second part from the perspective of two key questions concerning the impact of the emerging digital economy on management science research: What fundamentally new research questions arise, and what kind of research enables progress on them. We then offer summary comments on the second question based on the papers in both parts. The principal conclusions are that, in meeting the challenges posed by the digital economy, management science researchers are (a) making greater use of parts of economics and computer science/information technology, and (b) exploiting the improving productivity advantages of empirical and methodological work in comparison with theoretical work."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1875," A country's human capital and economic productivity increasingly depend on the Internet as a result of its expanding role in providing information and communications. This has prompted a search for ways to increase Internet adoption and narrow its disparity across countries—the global “digital divide.” Previous work has focused on demographic, economic, and infrastructure determinants of Internet access that are difficult to change in the short run. Internet content increases adoption and can be changed more quickly; however, the magnitude of its impact, and therefore its effectiveness as a policy and strategy tool, has until now been unknown. Quantifying the role of content is challenging because of feedback (network effects) between content and adoption: more content stimulates adoption, which in turn increases the incentive to create content. We develop a methodology to overcome this endogeneity problem. We find a statistically and economically significant effect, implying that policies promoting content creation can substantially increase adoption. Because it is ubiquitous, Internet content is also useful to effect social change across countries. Content has a greater effect on adoption in countries with more disparate languages, making it a useful tool to overcome linguistic isolation. Our results offer guidance for policymakers on country characteristics that influence adoption's responsiveness to content and for Internet firms on where to expand internationally and how to quantify content investments.

Although a number of institutional theories deal with information systems (IS) innovation in organizations, most of these institutional-centered frameworks overlook external economic efficiency and internal organizational capability in the presence of pressures of institutional conformity. Using Korea as the institutional setting, our research model posits that economic-based consideration will moderate the institutional conformity pressure on information security adoption while organization capability will influence the institutional confirmation of information security assimilation. The model is empirically tested using two-stage survey data from a field study of 140 organizations in Korea. The results indicate that in addition to institutional influences, our six proposed economic-based and organizational capability moderating variables all have significant influences on the degree of the adoption and assimilation of information security management. We conclude with implications for research in the area of organizational theory and the information security management literature, and for practices regarding how managers can factor into their information security planning the key implementation variables discovered in this study. The robust setting of the study in Korean firms allows us to generalize the theory to a new context and across cultures."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2021.1497," Born globals, recently established firms that obtain a substantial share of their revenue from foreign markets, can help strengthen countries’ economic vitality and increase innovation levels. The extent of born global formation varies considerably across countries, yet it is unclear why this is the case. Drawing on the neoconfigurational institutional perspective, we develop a typology of institutional contexts associated with high born global formation rates. We posit that high rates of born global formation occur where institutional features favorable to border-spanning activities complement institutional features conducive to entrepreneurial activity, thus forming an institutional configuration that enables, equips, and motivates more societal members to launch born globals. Accordingly, we hypothesize a primary institutional configuration where international transaction facilitators, entrepreneurial educational capital, and entrepreneurial norms combine to propel born global formation. Further, we draw on the internationalization literature to propose two alternative types of institutional configurations conducive to born global formation. These two types provide functional substitutes for the primary type and are distinctly propelled by (1) escapism from low-quality public governance institutions or (2) immigrant entrepreneurship. Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis on data from 66 countries supports our typology and illustrates why born global activity may thrive even in contexts with institutional weaknesses. Our study develops a neoconfigurational model to advance a holistic understanding of the born global phenomenon’s theoretical drivers, contributing to research on comparative capitalism and international entrepreneurship."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.1030.0046," Since the 1980s, the People's Republic of China has embarked on a path of economic transformation that has led to profound changes in organizations. Based on work histories of a sample of urban residents drawn from 14 Chinese cities in six provinces, we assess the extent and direction of organizational transformation by analyzing changes in promotion patterns between the prereform era (1949–1979) and the reform era (1980–1994). We begin with Walder's dual-path model and examine distinctive mechanisms for promotion along two institutionalized—administrative and professional—career lines. We enrich Walder's model by considering the impact of macropolitical processes on career dynamics and the effect of emerging market mechanisms on different organizational sectors. Our findings show that there have been both continuity and significant changes in the criteria and opportunities of promotion in Chinese organizations across the two periods. In the reform era, more educated managers who were recently recruited into the organizations had the highest probability of being promoted. There were also significant variations in promotion patterns across career lines and organizational sectors, reflecting the impacts of both institutional  persistence and emerging market forces."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0835," From a large array of economic and financial data series, this paper identifies three fundamental risk dimensions underlying an economy: inflation, real output growth, and financial market volatility. Furthermore, through a no-arbitrage model, the paper links the dynamics and market pricing of the three risk dimensions to the term structure of U.S. Treasury yields and corporate bond credit spreads. Model estimation shows that positive inflation shocks increase Treasury yields and widen credit spreads on corporate bonds across all maturities and credit-rating classes. Positive real output growth shocks also increase Treasury yields, but they suppress the credit spreads at low credit-rating classes, thus generating negative correlations between interest rates and credit spreads. The financial market volatility factor has a small and transient effect on the Treasury yield curve, but it exerts a strongly positive and persistent effect on the credit spread term structure. The paper provides a robust and internally consistent method for extracting systematic economic information from a large array of noisy observations and establishing how different risk dimensions of the fundamental economy interact with interest rate and credit risk."
/doi/10.1287/isre.1110.0409," Digital divide initiatives in developing countries are an important avenue for the socioeconomic advancement of those countries. Yet little research has focused on understanding the success of such initiatives. We develop a model of technology use and economic outcomes of digital divide initiatives in developing countries. We use social networks as the guiding theoretical lens because it is well suited to this context, given the low literacy, high poverty, high collectivism, and an oral tradition of information dissemination in developing countries. We test our model with longitudinal data gathered from 210 families in a rural village in India in the context of a digital divide initiative. As theorized, we found that the social network constructs contributed significantly to the explanation of technology use ( R 2 = 0.39). Also as we predicted, technology use partially mediated the effect of social network constructs on economic outcomes ( R 2 = 0.47). We discuss implications for theory and practice."
/doi/10.1287/stsc.2017.0045," Our purpose is to develop a perspective on how executives form superior strategies in entrepreneurial settings. Understanding how executives achieve such strategies is theoretically intriguing because it pushes beyond the boundary conditions of the traditional strategic logics of position and leverage to the less-understood opportunity logic where advantage is precarious and often short-lived. Understanding how executives form superior strategies in entrepreneurial settings is also practically relevant. Strategically successful firms in these settings like Apple, Facebook, and Dropbox are primary motors for economic growth, but their strategists are challenged by the “high velocity” of their markets and opportunities. Our perspective combines two intertwined themes: (1) broad view of the strategic playing field enabling better visibility and understanding of opportunities (thinking) and (2) action within structures organized at the “edge of chaos” enabling flexible yet efficient capture of opportunities (doing). We describe these themes and opportunity logic and then contrast them with traditional strategic logics like positioning and resource leverage."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2013," Guided by theories of “management by exception,” we study the impact of information and communication technology on worker and plant manager autonomy and span of control. The theory suggests that information technology is a decentralizing force, whereas communication technology is a centralizing force. Using a new data set of American and European manufacturing firms, we find indeed that better information technologies (enterprise resource planning (ERP) for plant managers and computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacturing for production workers) are associated with more autonomy and a wider span of control, whereas technologies that improve communication (like data intranets) decrease autonomy for workers and plant managers. Using instrumental variables (distance from ERP’s place of origin and heterogeneous telecommunication costs arising from regulation) strengthens our results.

/doi/10.1287/orsc.1090.0513," We analyze the microfoundations of the routine in a study of price-adjustment processes at a manufacturing firm. Existing theory says that truces balance cognitive and motivational differences across functions, but there is scant evidence on how truces work. We show both stability and change in routines. For minor price adjustments, routines incorporate truces in stable but separate market interpretations by the sales and marketing groups. Major price changes put truces at risk, as latent conflict over information and interests becomes overt. The ensuing battle shows how interests, information, and truces are intertwined in performing the routine. Routines are not just stable entities, but adaptive performances that include conflict. We illustrate how our approach addresses fundamental problems such as how firms perform economics, how routines incorporate economic theory, and how routines shape macroeconomic dynamics. We argue that our approach can be extended to any routine-based organizational work."

/doi/10.1287/stsc.2019.0088," Network effects and complementarities are salient features of the digital economy. We examine whether complementarities can help a firm enter a market with strong network effects and incumbency advantages. We provide conditions under which bundling the network good with a complementary good can be an optimal entry strategy, and we show that this strategy should not be subject to anticompetitive concerns (in both the short and the long term). When product complementarity is weak enough, we also show that an entrant may prefer a more cooperative approach not based on bundling but rather on extending the complementarity benefits to the incumbent’s network good."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2018.1124," Despite the growth of online retail, the majority of products are still sold offline, and the “touch-and-feel” aspect of physically examining a product before purchase remains important to many consumers. In this paper, we demonstrate that large discrepancies can exist between how consumers evaluate products when examining them “live” versus based on online descriptions, even for a relatively familiar product (messenger bags) and for utilitarian features. Therefore, the use of online evaluations in market research may result in inaccurate predictions and potentially suboptimal decisions by the firm. Because eliciting preferences by conducting large-scale offline market research is costly, we propose fusing data from a large online study with data from a smaller set of participants who complete both an online and an offline study. We demonstrate our approach using conjoint studies on two sets of participants. The group who completed both online and offline studies allows us to calibrate the relationship between online and offline partworths. To obtain reliable parameter estimates, we propose two statistical methods: a hierarchical Bayesian approach and a k- nearest-neighbors approach. We demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better out-of-sample predictive performance on individual choices (up to 25% improvement), as well as aggregate market shares (up to 33% improvement).

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.48.12.1517.437," Groups of organizations are pervasive, although there is little systematic knowledge about how they affect their members. We examine one dimension of the operation of organization groups, the transfer of experience. Our core argument is that organization groups may create benefits for their members, but problems for those outside the group. Within the group they can facilitate the transfer of experience among their members by creating mechanisms for communication, incentives for helping, and by promoting understanding. The predicted pattern of experience transfer should improve performance of those within the group, but also has implications for those outside it. Experience accumulated in one organization group strengthens the competitiveness of its organizations, and thereby harms competitors outside the group. Thus, organization groups are fundamental both for the functioning of their members and the competitive dynamics of their industries. Our longitudinal analysis of the profitability of kibbutz agriculture supports both these claims. Between 1954 and 1965 (the years of this study), almost all kibbutzim were part of organization groups. Kibbutzim became more profitable as a function of the experience of others in their group. Their profitability was reduced, however, as a function of experience of others outside their group."
/doi/10.1287/trsc.2013.0464," In this paper we use Bayes estimates of a multinomial probit model with fully flexible substitution patterns to forecast consumer response to ultra-low-emission vehicles. In this empirical application of the probit Gibbs sampler, we use stated-preference data on vehicle choice from a Germany-wide survey of potential light-duty-vehicle buyers using computer-assisted personal interviewing. We show that Bayesian estimation of a multinomial probit model with a full covariance matrix is feasible for this medium-scale problem and provides results that are very similar to maximum simulated likelihood estimates. Using the posterior distribution of the parameters of the vehicle choice model as well as the GHK simulator, we derive the choice probabilities of the different alternatives. We first show that the Bayes point estimates of the market shares reproduce the observed values. Then we define a base scenario of vehicle attributes that aims to represent an average of the current vehicle choice situation in Germany. Consumer response to qualitative changes in the base scenario is subsequently studied. In particular, we analyze the effect of increasing the network of service stations for charging electric vehicles as well as for refueling hydrogen. The result is the posterior distribution of the choice probabilities that represent adoption of the energy-efficient technologies."
/doi/10.1287/stsc.2021.0129," Does culture eat strategy for breakfast? This paper investigates the interactions among corporate culture, norms, and strategy, in order to better understand this issue and related questions. It first shows, through microfoundations, how the forces that drive toward “culture as shared beliefs and preferences” also cause the emergence of social norms (when these beliefs and preferences are unobservable), with people even endogenously enforcing norms that go against their own beliefs and preferences. The latter effect may cause a disconnect between the organization’s norms and its underlying beliefs and preferences. The paper then makes predictions on the kinds of shared beliefs, preferences, and norms that are likely to emerge, and when they are most likely to emerge. It shows, for example, that social norms are more likely in attractive organizations, for behaviors that have modest personal consequences, and on dimensions along which employees depend on others’ choices to a moderate degree. Building on these insights and on the definition of “strategy as core guidance,” we finally discuss how corporate culture and strategy interact. We show, in particular, how culture is not just an input into strategy but also a direct substitute for strategy and often even a competitor. The results throw light on ways to deal with the “breakfast” issue."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2021.1429," This study investigates the negative relationship between firm risk and accounting performance known in the strategy field as the Bowman paradox, which has been generally attributed to differences across firms in their willingness to take risk. Most research to date relies on the behavioral theory of the firm to suggest that underperformers take greater risks to increase their performance to their reference point. As an alternative explanation, we suggest that the Bowman paradox may result from the inherent vulnerability of low performers to negative external shocks. Our panel analysis of 2,681 U.S. firms from 1980 to 2010 confirms that firms with lower performance within their industry are more affected by negative shocks to the economy. The asymmetric vulnerability of low performers to external events makes their overall accounting performance more volatile and difficult to predict by market analysts, even if all firms have a similar attitude toward risk taking and capabilities to manage change. Our vulnerability explanation is also supported by our empirical analysis of the 2008 global financial crisis as a natural experiment. Furthermore, we find strong evidence of a negative risk–return relationship using different methods to control for their endogeneity."
/doi/10.1287/moor.1040.0090," This paper considers a Markovian model of a service system motivated by communication and information services. The system has finite processing capacity and offers multiple grades of service. The highest priority users receive a “guaranteed” processing rate, while lower priority users share residual capacity according to their priority level and therefore may experience service degradation (hence the term “best effort”). This paper focuses on performance analysis for this class of systems. We consider the Halfin-Whitt heavy-traffic regime, where the arrival rate and system processing capacity both grow large in a way that the traffic intensity approaches one. We first derive a multidimensional diffusion approximation for the system dynamics and subsequently obtain a more tractable diffusion limit based on an intuitive “perturbation approach.” This method enables us to compute various closed form approximations to steady-state as well as transient congestion-related performance measures. Numerical examples illustrate the accuracy of these approximations."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2014.0532," Human capital is becoming more critical as the global economy becomes more information intensive and service intensive. Although information systems (IS) researchers have studied some dimensions of human capital, the role of industry-specific human capital has remained understudied. The information technology enabled business process outsourcing (BPO) industry provides an ideal setting to study returns to human capital, because jobs in this industry are standardized and many professionals in this new industry have come from other industries. We build on IS and economics literature to theorize returns to human capital in the BPO industry, and we test the theory using data for over 2,500 BPO professionals engaged in call center work and other nonvoice services (e.g., accounting, finance, human resources, etc.) in India during the 2006–2008 time period. We find higher returns to industry-specific human capital than to firm-specific and general human capital. We also find that junior-level professionals, whose jobs are relatively more standardized, have higher returns to industry-specific human capital than senior-level professionals. We discuss implications for further research and practice in the global economy where inter-industry transfers and migration of skills are becoming increasingly common."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3295," In the wake of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, social-media platforms are facing increasing pressure to combat the propagation of “fake news” (i.e., articles whose content is fabricated). Motivated by recent attempts in this direction, we consider the problem faced by a social-media platform that is observing the sharing actions of a sequence of rational agents and is dynamically choosing whether to conduct an inspection (i.e., a “fact-check”) of an article whose validity is ex ante unknown. We first characterize the agents’ inspection and sharing actions and establish that, in the absence of any platform intervention, the agents’ news-sharing process is prone to the proliferation of fabricated content, even when the agents are intent on sharing only truthful news. We then study the platform’s inspection problem. We find that because the optimal policy is adapted to crowdsource inspection from the agents, it exhibits features that may appear a priori nonobvious; most notably, we show that the optimal inspection policy is nonmonotone in the ex ante probability that the article being shared is fake. We also investigate the effectiveness of the platform’s policy in mitigating the detrimental impact of fake news on the agents’ learning environment. We demonstrate that in environments characterized by a low (high) prevalence of fake news, the platform’s policy is more effective when the rewards it collects from content sharing are low relative to the penalties it incurs from the sharing of fake news (when the rewards it collects from content sharing are high in absolute terms).

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1098," To date, optimization models of endogenous technological change commonly deal with uncertainty in technological learning with risk-factor methods, i.e., by adding expected risk costs resulting from overestimating technological learning rates into an objective function with a subjective risk factor. This paper argues that another way of coping with the uncertainty, risk-constrained methods that have been ignored in existing literatures, could be more practicable (at least as a supplement) for decision support. With a simplified model, this paper explores technology development paths generated by two risk-constrained methods, and compares the two risk-constrained methods with a risk-factor method. Our study shows that comparing with the risk-factor method, the two risk-constrained methods also generate an S-shaped technology diffusion pattern, which accords with historical observations, and they can result in earlier as well as later adoption of an advanced but currently expensive technology, depending on different combinations of uncertainty levels of the technology learning rate and the upper limit on the expected risk cost. Another finding of our research is that two totally different technology development paths can both be optimal solutions, which implies that with early policy interventions there is the possibility that an economy could be led to a low-carbon economy with little additional cost."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2016.1004," Product lines are ubiquitous. For example, Marriott International manages high-end ultra-luxury hotels (e.g., Ritz-Carlton) and low-end economy hotels (e.g., Fairfield Inn). Firms often bundle core products with ancillary services (or add-ons). Interestingly, empirical observations reveal that industries with ostensibly similar characteristics (e.g., customer types, costs, competition, distribution channels, etc.) employ different bundling strategies. For example, airlines bundle high-end first class with ancillary services (e.g., breakfast, entertainment) while hotel chains bundle ancillary services (e.g., breakfast, entertainment) at the low-end. We observe, unlike hotel lines that are highly differentiated at different geographic locations, airlines suffer low core differentiation because all passengers (first-class and economy) are at the same location (i.e., same plane, weather, delays, cancellations, etc.). In general, we find product lines with low core differentiation (e.g., airlines, amusement parks) routinely bundle high-end while product lines with highly differentiated cores (e.g., hotels, restaurants) routinely bundle low-end. High-end bundling makes the high-end more attractive, increasing line differentiation (less intraline competition) while low-end bundling decreases line differentiation. Therefore, bundling allows optimal differentiation given a differentiation constraint (complex costs). Last, firms may use strategic bundling for targeting in their core products; e.g., low-end hotels bundle targeted add-ons unattractive to high-end consumers such as lower-quality breakfasts and slower Internet.

/doi/10.1287/mksc.21.1.97.161," As firms jockey to position themselves in emerging markets, firms need to evaluate the relative attractiveness of market expansion in different countries. Since the attractiveness of a market is a function of the eventual market potential and the speed at which the product diffuses through the market, a better understanding of the determinants of market potential and diffusion speed across different countries is of particular relevance to firms deliberating their market expansion strategies. Despite a recent spurt in research on multinational diffusion, there exist significant gaps in the literature. First, existing studies tend to limit their analysis to industrialized countries, thus reducing the ability to generalize the insights to many emerging markets. Second, these studies tend to focus on the coefficients of external and internal influence in the Bass diffusion model but do not analyze the determinants of market potential. Third, the choice of variables that affect the parameters of the Bass diffusion model has been rather limited. In this paper, we seek to address these gaps in the literature. To address the scope issue, we assembled a novel dataset that captures the diffusion of 6 products in 31 developed and developing countries from Europe, Asia, and North and South America. The set of countries in our dataset encompasses 60% of the world population and includes such emerging economies as China, India, Brazil, and Thailand. This should provide us with a stronger basis to make empirical generalizations about the diffusion process. For firms seeking to expand into emerging international markets, our findings about penetration potential have considerable significance. For example, we find that for the set of products that we analyze the average penetration potential for developing countries is about one-third (0.17 versus 0.52) of that for developed countries. We also find that it takes developing countries on average 17.9% (19.25 versus 16.33 years) longer to achieve peak sales. Thus, despite the well-known positive effect of product introduction delays on diffusion speed, we find that developing countries still continue to experience a slower adoption rate, compared to that of developed countries. Our study also investigated the impact of several new macroenvironmental variables on penetration potential and speed. For example, our findings indicate that a 1% change in international trade or urbanization level can potentially change the penetration potential by about 0.5% and 0.2% respectively. These are some of the key variables projected to change significantly over the coming years for developing countries. While business managers have relatively little influence on such variables, our findings can still serve as valuable empirical guide for the variables that they should consider in evaluating diverse international markets and in performing sensitivity analysis with respect to their projected trends. Finally, our study also holds implications for managers seeking to combine information about past diffusion patterns across products and countries for better prediction. We pool information efficiently across multiple products and countries using a Hierarchical Bayes estimation methodology. By sharing information across countries and products in a single, coherent framework, we find that this pooling approach leads to substantial improvements in prediction accuracy. Our technique is particularly superior in predicting sales and BDM parameter values in the early years of new product introduction in a new country, when forecast estimates are managerially most useful. We also decompose the variance in the BDM model parameters into product, country, and product-country components. These results give guidelines to managers about which market experience they should weigh more to arrive at forecasts of market potential and diffusion speed. We find that while past experiences of other products in a country (country effects) are relatively more useful to explain penetration level (cumulative sales), past experiences in other countries where a product was earlier introduced (product effects) are more useful to explain the coefficients of external and internal influence (and thus the speed with which the product will attain peak sales)."
