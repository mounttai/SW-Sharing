/doi/10.1287/inte.11.3.75," This article presents the results of an extensive study of the current use of computer programs in MS curricula. Reporting the findings for 109 business schools, the authors rank the availability, use, and importance of 14 commonly used “canned” MS programs. We conclude that faculty interest in a package of MS computer programs analogous to SPSS is very high. However, current use of most programs, especially in larger business schools and doctoral programs, is not widespread. The study provides an overview of the state of the art in today's computer linkage with Management Science, and the computer hardware currently in use in US business schools."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2018.1095," The interplay between innovation and the stock market has been extensively studied by scholars across all business disciplines. However, one phenomenon remains understudied: the association between innovation and stock market bubbles. Bubbles—defined as rapid increases and subsequent declines in stock prices—have been primarily examined by economists who generally do not focus on individual characteristics of innovations or on the consequences of bubbles for their parent firms. We set out to fill this gap in our paper. Using a sample of 51 major innovations introduced between 1825 and 2000, we test for bubbles in the stock prices of parent firms subsequent to the commercialization of these innovations. We identify bubbles in 73% of the cases. The magnitude of these bubbles increases with the radicalness of innovations, with their potential to generate indirect network effects, and with their public visibility at the time of commercialization. Moreover, we find that parent firms typically raise new equity capital during bubble periods and that the amount of equity raised is proportional to the magnitude of the bubble. Finally, we show that the buy-and-hold abnormal returns of parent firms are significantly positive between the beginning and the end of the bubble, suggesting that these innovations add value to their firm and to the economy, in spite of the bubble. Our findings have important implications for managers interested in commercializing innovations and for policy makers concerned with the stability of the financial system.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2670," Recent work suggests that an excessive focus on “managing the numbers”—delivering quarterly earnings at the expense of longer-term performance—makes it difficult for firms to make the investments necessary to build competitive advantage. “Short termism” has been blamed for everything from the decline of the U.S. automobile industry to the low penetration of techniques such as total quality management and continuous improvement. Yet a significant body of research suggests that firms that sacrifice long-term investment to manage earnings are often rewarded for doing so. This paper presents a model to help reconcile the tension between these apparently contradictory perspectives. We show that if the source of long-term advantage is modeled as a stock of capability that accumulates over time, the intensity of the firm’s effort to manage short-term earnings at the expense of long-term investment can have very different consequences depending on whether the firm’s capability is close to a critical “tipping threshold.” When the firm operates above this threshold, aggressively managing earnings smooths revenue and cash flow with few long-term consequences. Below it, managing earnings can tip the firm into a vicious cycle of accelerating decline. Our results have important implications for understanding managerial incentives and the internal processes that create sustained advantage.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2406," The introduction of tablets in online retailing has created an additional touchpoint through which e-commerce firms can interact with consumers. In this paper, we seek to understand and measure the causal impact of tablets on e-commerce sales. In doing so, we examine the complementary and substitution impact of the tablet channel on the smartphone and PC channels. We rely on a unique data set from Alibaba, the largest e-commerce firm in the world, and exploit a natural experiment via the iPad app introduction to empirically identify our results. The results show that users’ adoption of tablets enhanced the overall growth of Alibaba’s e-commerce market, with an annual increase of approximately US$923.5 million. Our results demonstrate that the tablet channel acts as a substitute for the PC channel while it acts as a complement for the smartphone channel. Furthermore, the use of tablets spurs casual browsing, which leads to the purchase of more impulse products and a wider diversity of products. Cross-device browsing behavior is found to enhance sales outcomes, and the degree of interrelationships between devices varies across the course of the day. We provide insights for retailers about how they can increase their sales volume and revenue in the emerging tablet economy. This paper was accepted by Anandhi Bharadwaj, information systems ."
/doi/10.1287/opre.2019.1949," As self-interested individuals (“agents”) make decisions over time, they utilize information revealed by other agents in the past and produce information that may help agents in the future. This phenomenon is common in a wide range of scenarios in the Internet economy, as well as in medical decisions. Each agent would like to exploit : select the best action given the current information, but would prefer the previous agents to explore : try out various alternatives to collect information. A social planner, by means of a carefully designed recommendation policy, can incentivize the agents to balance the exploration and exploitation so as to maximize social welfare. We model the planner’s recommendation policy as a multiarm bandit algorithm under incentive-compatibility constraints induced by agents’ Bayesian priors. We design a bandit algorithm which is incentive-compatible and has asymptotically optimal performance, as expressed by regret. Further, we provide a black-box reduction from an arbitrary multiarm bandit algorithm to an incentive-compatible one, with only a constant multiplicative increase in regret. This reduction works for very general bandit settings that incorporate contexts and arbitrary partial feedback."
/doi/10.1287/inte.6.1pt2.43," The Kansas Legistlature in 1968 provided for the reclamation of land strip-mined for coal after January 1, 1969, but there was no provision for the reclamation of the approximately 50,000 acres strip-mined in Southeast Kansas prior to that date. Concern of the residents of the area to return the land to productive use and concern of the Kansas Geological Survey with the conflict between mineral production and other social and economic activities in rural areas resulted in the formation of an “Action Group” with the purpose of: (1) determining strip-mined land ownership and availability for redevelopment; (2) determining and demonstrating productive use of strip-mined land; and (3) determining sources of funds for redevelopment projects. Initial contact with land owners indicated a reluctance to reclaim their land; essentially, there were no funds available for reclamation. Several means for overcoming the lack of money and reluctance of landowners to participate in reclamation were tried, but with no success. Finally, basic data gathered from agriculture agencies were computerized. Linear programming and modeling of one rancher's operation indicated cattle grazing to be profitable on reclaimed land. An interactive computer program was developed to allow landowners to evaluate their own expectations. Output from the model and the linear program were used to convince a governmental agency to share the cost of demonstration projects totaling 1,300 acres. Five thousand acres have been reclaimed in Kansas, as of July 1, 1974, with an economic impact of $2,000,000 on the region. This once unproductive land generates $1,000,000 annually. Most significantly, the tax base has been increased for many school districts and political divisions located in heavily strip-mined areas."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.1120.0796," The ongoing fragmentation of work has resulted in a narrowing of tasks into smaller pieces that can be sent outside the organization and, in many instances, around the world. This trend is shifting the boundaries of organizations and leading to increased outsourcing. Though the consolidation of volume may lead to productivity improvement, little is known about how this shift toward outsourcing influences learning by providers of outsourced services. When producing output, the content of the knowledge gained can vary from one unit to the next. One dimension along which output can vary—a dimension with particular relevance in outsourcing—is the end customer for whom it is produced. The performance benefits of such customer experience remain largely unexamined. We explore this dimension of volume-based learning in a setting where doctors at an outsourcing firm complete radiological reads for hospital customers. We examine more than 2.7 million cases read by 97 radiologists for 1,431 customers and find evidence supporting the benefits of customer-specific experience accumulated by individual radiologists. Additionally, we find that variety in an individual’s customer experience may increase the rate of individual learning from customer-specific experience for a focal task. Finally, we find that the level of experience with a customer for the entire outsourcing firm also yields learning and that the degree of customer depth moderates the impact of customer-specific experience at the individual level. We discuss the implications of our results for the study of learning as well as for providers and consumers of outsourced services."
/doi/10.1287/opre.2016.1527," This paper focuses on revealed preference tests of the collective model of household consumption. We start by showing that the decision problems corresponding to testing collective rationality are NP-complete. This makes the application of these tests problematic for (increasingly available) large(r)-scale data sets. We then present two approaches to overcome this negative result. First, we introduce exact algorithms based on mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations of the collective rationality tests, which can be usefully applied to medium-sized data sets. Next, we propose simulated annealing heuristics, which allow for efficient testing of the collective model in the case of large data sets. We illustrate our methods by a number of computational experiments based on Dutch labor supply data."
/doi/10.1287/inte.6.1pt2.64," This case heard before the National Energy Board (NEB) in 1966 and the decision of Lester B. Pearson's government to reject the Trans Canada Pipe Lines - Great Lakes Gas Transmission project in its original form, marks the first occasion where management science had a determining impact on Canadian public policy. It also marked a psychological breakthrough within the NEB's organization as it provided its newly created Operations Research Branch with the essential credibility base in order to effectively influence NEB's decision-making process. This paper describes TCPL's application of 1966 to expand East/West flow of natural gas by construction of a new, larger diameter pipeline, passing in the United States, south of the Great Lakes rather than expanding the TCPL system north of the Great Lakes. In support of its application, Trans Canada filed an extensive study to demonstrate that the Great Lakes proposal would result in lower costs of natural gas transportation than the expansion of its existing system and would open up new markets for Canadian natural gas in the north central region of the U. S. This paper shows how Operations Research Branch dissented with Trans Canada's position and managed to convince NEB's chairman and key branch heads that a number of staff studies had to be performed before arriving at a conclusion. These O-R studies ranged from the assessment of new pipeline technology to the use of various O-R techniques. These O-R studies met with varying degrees of acceptance; however, the contribution that had the most significant impact was a new methodology for comparison of transportation costs via two alternative routes serving different markets. Furthermore, the O-R branch performed differential economic impact studies to take into account the multiplier effects on the Canadian economy of the two projects which indicated an estimated advantage of a billion dollars in favour of expanding the Northern route. In the end a compromise solution which maintained the Northern loop as the main gas transmission system of TCPL was adopted."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2017.0712," We empirically examine the impact of expanded product variety on demand concentration using large data sets from the movie rental industry as our test bed. We find that product variety is likely to increase demand concentration, which goes against the “long tail effect” theory predicting that demand will become less concentrated on “hit” products because of expanded product variety. We further provide evidence that this finding is not due to introducing many low-selling niche products, as the intuition might suggest. Instead, we discover that increasing product variety diversifies the demand away from each movie title, but less significantly for hits than for niche products. In particular, we find that increasing product variety by 1,000 titles may increase the Gini coefficient of DVD rentals by 0.0029, which translates to increasing the market share of the top 1% of DVDs by 1.96% and the market share of the top 10% of DVDs by 0.58%. At the same time, the market share of the bottom 1% of DVDs is reduced by 21.29%, while the market share of the bottom 10% of DVDs is reduced by 5.28%. We rule out alternative explanations using a variety of long tail metrics, capturing movie format/distribution channel interaction and customer heterogeneity, while making use of instrumental variables."
/doi/10.1287/opre.2019.1878," We consider a capacity provider and a group of independent buyers who partner to share a scarce but expensive-to-build capacity over a finite horizon under privately informed demand conditions. At the beginning of the time horizon, the capacity provider must invest in building capacity; all members may invest in increasing their own and possibly other members’ market sizes. Then each member observes and updates its private, history-dependent demand information over time. Because the value of the capacity to each member is highly uncertain when investment is made, achieving the first-best outcome while sustaining under a dynamic environment is challenging for the partnership. We address this issue by proposing a multiperiod membership-type agreement (referred to as the Agreement ) as a series of single-period contracts with flexible terms that are renegotiated each period. The Agreement enforces ex post efficient capacity allocation and ex ante efficient investment. The set of interpartner transfers in the Agreement makes each member a residual claimant to the surplus it creates, and hence induces truthful demand reports. This contract is also budget balanced and voluntary . In doing so, we develop a new solution concept for dynamic collective action mechanisms."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.43.6.856," The research proposes a model, which relates the following variables: (a) the CEO's perceptions of the environment, (b) the strategic business orientation, scanning, and structural characteristics, (c) technology policy, (d) realized innovative efforts of the firm, and (e) measures of firm performance. The empirical data from small manufacturing enterprises (SMEs) that share a common economic and industrial environment show that CEOs' perceptions of external environment—and not objective measures—are key significant issues with respect to technology policy formulation and enactment in SMEs and its subsequent organizational impacts. In particular, perceived environmental hostility and dynamism are shown to have specific and differing moderating roles on the form and strength of the relationships between technology policy and its determinants and between technology policy and realized innovative efforts. Furthermore, a more aggressive technology policy leads to greater realized innovative efforts, which in turn are positively related to export performance and, to a lesser extent, to financial performance."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1175," This paper investigates how self-optimizing engineers affect new product development (NPD) project outcomes and development times. A variety of widely used NPD project management approaches, including heavyweight project management, may allow or even encourage engineers to introduce late design changes and exhibit weak cost compliance, reducing the product's profit or competitiveness. Providing specifically designed incentives for individuals can eliminate such encouragement, and thus improve cost compliance and project timeliness. This paper discusses several practical incentive schemes, including profit-sharing contracts and component-level target costing. For many industrial projects, component-level target costing makes the most efficient use of available information to optimize project outcomes and reduce development times."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1501," We propose a new method for measuring the quality of banks' credit portfolios. This method makes use of information embedded in bank share prices by exploiting differences in their sensitivity to credit default swap spreads of borrowers of varying quality. The method allows us to derive a credit risk indicator (CRI). This indicator represents the perceived share of high-risk exposures in a bank's portfolio and can be used as a risk weight for computing regulatory capital requirements. We estimate CRIs for the 150 largest U.S. bank holding companies. We find that their CRIs are able to forecast bank failures and share price performances during the crisis of 2007–2009, even after controlling for a variety of traditional asset quality and general risk proxies.

/doi/10.1287/orsc.2018.1212," Recognizing the need to better understand institutional change processes in authoritarian states, which play an increasingly prominent role in the world economy, we examine the efficacy of civic activism aimed at spurring governmental action concerning the environmental performance of firms in China. We highlight the paradox of “responsive authoritarianism” on display in China: to avoid needing to rule by coercion alone, the government seeks citizens’ feedback and tolerates pressures for change, but at the same time it resists the associated legitimacy threats regarding its capacity to rule. Local governments and the media play crucial and dual roles in this system: they mitigate change pressures from civic activism that takes place within the state’s systems, but they magnify change pressures from publicly visible civic activism occurring outside those systems. We test our conceptual model using a unique data set of environmental penalties imposed on Chinese publicly listed firms from 2007 to 2011. Our findings contribute to understanding processes of institutional change and outcomes of social movements. The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2018.1212 ."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1149," The use of H-1B and other work visas to hire foreign information technology (IT) professionals in the United States has attracted significant controversy and policy debates. On one hand, hiring high-skill foreign IT professionals on work visas can be advantageous for U.S. firms and the overall economy. On the other hand, high-skill immigration can adversely impact the wages of foreign and American IT professionals. This study uses data on skills and compensation of more than 50,000 IT professionals in the United States over the period 2000–2005 to study patterns in compensation of foreign and American IT professionals to inform these debates. Contrary to the popular belief that foreign workers are a cheap source of labor for U.S. firms, we find that after controlling for their human capital attributes, foreign IT professionals (those without U.S. citizenship and those with H-1B or other work visas) earn a salary premium when compared with IT professionals with U.S. citizenship. The salary premiums for non-U.S. citizens and for those on work visas fluctuate in response to supply shocks created by the annual caps on new H-1B visas. Setting lower and fully utilized annual caps results in higher salary premiums for non-U.S. citizens and those with work visas. We discuss implications of this study for crafting informed visa- and immigration-related policies by the U.S. government, for staffing practices of firms, and for human capital investments by IT professionals."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3380," We propose that investor beliefs frequently “cross” in the sense that an investor may like company A but dislike company B, whereas another investor may like company B but dislike company A. Such belief-crossing makes it almost impossible to construct a portfolio that is composed solely of every investor’s most favored companies. This causes the level of excitement for portfolios to be generally lower than the levels of excitement that individual companies generate among their most fervent supporters. Coupled with short-sale constraints, wherein prices are set by the most optimistic investors, this causes portfolios to trade at discounts. Utilizing several settings whereby the value of a portfolio and the values of the underlying components can be evaluated separately (e.g., closed-end funds), we present evidence supporting our proposition that, in financial markets, the “whole” is often less than the “sum of its parts.” This paper was accepted by Karl Diether, finance."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.47.7.915.9806," This article considers the problem of coordinating the admission rates and service requirements of a multiclass queue when these decisions are made on a decentralized basis. The customer classes are characterized by different demand patterns, delay costs, and service costs. Customers make individual decisions on whether to join the queue and, if so, their service requirements. Their class identities and service requirements are private information not known to the system manager. We develop a two-stage decision framework to analyze the problem and characterize the optimal admission rates and service requirements under both centralized and decentralized assumptions. We distinguish admission and service externality costs that lead to suboptimal performance under decentralized control. For a given service discipline, we derive optimal class-specific pricing schemes that can coordinate the system when only service requirements but not class identities are unobservable. When customer class identities are also unobservable, we consider two common service disciplines that offer undifferentiated service: processor sharing and first-come-first-served. Based on the general framework, for the M/G/s processor sharing queue, we show that a single variable fee (payment per unit of time in the system) can induce the optimal admission rates and service requirements for all customer classes. For the M/G/ 1 first-come-first-served queue, we show that a single pricing scheme that is quadratic in time in service can induce the optimal admission rates and service requirements for all customer classes. Our result demonstrates that, under suitable conditions, simple and undifferentiated pricing can coordinate complex queueing systems with heterogeneous customer classes."
/doi/10.1287/ijoc.2019.0886," Viral-marketing strategies are of significant interest in the online economy. Roughly, in these problems, one seeks to identify which individuals to strategically target in a social network so that a given proportion of the network is influenced at minimum cost. Earlier literature has focused primarily on problems where a fixed inducement is provided to those targeted. In contrast, resembling the practical viral-marketing setting, we consider this problem where one is allowed to “partially influence” (by the use of monetary inducements) those selected for targeting. We thus focus on the “least-cost influence problem (LCIP)”: an influence-maximization problem where the goal is to find the minimum total amount of inducements (individuals to target and associated tailored incentive) required to influence a given proportion of the population. Motivated by the desire to develop a better understanding of fundamental problems in social-network analytics, we seek to develop (exact) optimization approaches for the LCIP. Our paper makes several contributions, including (i) showing that the problem is NP-complete in general as well as under a wide variety of special conditions; (ii) providing an influence greedy algorithm to solve the problem polynomially on trees, where we require 100% adoption and all neighbors exert equal influence on a node; and (iii) a totally unimodular formulation for this tree case."
/doi/10.1287/msom.1110.0345," Nonprofit organizations are a critical part of society as well as a growing sector of the economy. For funders there is an increasing and pressing need to ensure that society reaps the most social benefit for their money while also developing the nonprofit sector as a whole. By routinely scrutinizing nonprofit reports in an effort to deduce whether a nonprofit organization is efficient, funders may believe that they are, in fact, giving responsibly. However, we find that these nonprofit reports are unreliable, supporting a myriad of empirical research and revealing that report-based funding methods do not facilitate efficient allocation of funds. In response, we develop audit contracts that put funders in a position to enact change. Auditing, perhaps obviously, supports funders; however, we find that it also benefits the population of nonprofits. Moreover, auditing results in improved efficiency for the nonprofit sector overall. Indeed, our conclusions indicate that nonprofits may want to work with funders to increase the use of auditing, consequently increasing efficiency for the sector overall and impacting society as a whole."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.46.4.530.12055," An innovative business practice attributed to the information technology (IT) industry is the aggressive use of employee stock options to compensate executives and other employees. In this study, we investigate whether the greater use of stock options in the IT industry can be explained on the basis of general economic relationships that apply to firms in all industries. To examine differences in compensating top executives, we estimate a system of simultaneous equations that is designed to accommodate interconnections between performance, the level of compensation, and the mix of compensation components. We document that the shares of both bonus and option pay increase with performance and that the pay level and the extent of incentive pay positively affect firm performance. We identify economic factors that may influence the use of options and show that there are significant differences in these factors between IT and other industries. We find that, while much of the greater use of options by IT firms is explained by the economic factors, significant residual differences remain. We also find that, when performance and other factors are considered, the level of executive pay in the IT industry is not higher than in other industries."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2021.4152," We study how access to high-skill labor affects the outcomes of start-up firms. We obtain exogenous variation in firms’ ability to access skilled labor by using win rates in H-1B visa lotteries. Relative to other firms that also applied for H-1B visas, firms with higher lottery win rates are more likely to receive additional venture capital funding and to have a successful exit via an IPO or acquisition. H-1B visa lottery winners also subsequently receive more patents and patent citations. Overall, our results suggest that access to high-skill labor is a critical determinant of success for start-up firms. This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.1060.0226," This paper develops a model of how organizations influence the temporal flexibility of professional service workers. The model starts by identifying a key source of temporal inflexibility for these workers: an inability to hand clients off among one other. Hand-offs are impeded by high levels of client-to-worker specificity, stemming from three common characteristics of professional service work. The organizational processes that reduce that specificity, and therefore facilitate hand-offs, function by (a) reshaping client participation and expectations about the nature of their service interactions, (b) partly standardizing client-related work practices, and (c) facilitating the sharing of knowledge about clients between workers. The presence of these organizational processes represents greater bureaucracy—an interesting twist, given that they create more temporal flexibility for workers. The model is grounded in field research conducted with primary care physicians, and is also evaluated using a unique survey data set of physician organizations. Implications are drawn for the study of temporal flexibility across professional services in general, as well as for recent attempts to rethink the meaning of bureaucracy for workers."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2020.3880," We analyze how market design choices about counterparty information and costs related to the “plumbing” (i.e., clearing, settlement, and custody) of securities markets affect market quality and welfare. Our model compares two post-trade fee structures for allocating these costs. One charges a uniform fee for all trades and the other, marginal cost–based structure a reduced fee for internalized trades (which, both traders being from the same broker, is less costly to process). Both market design and fee structure affect quote aggressiveness and trading volume and its composition. With marginal cost–based fees and counterparty information being available, traders decide which counterparties to target through quote aggressiveness, trading off execution probability against fee. A social planner can maximize welfare by requiring marginal cost–based fees and providing traders the choice to disclose counterparty information. This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.1100.0548," Organizations in an emerging organizational population face an identity problem. Collectively, organizations cannot yet rely on a coherent and stable definition of what membership in that new industry means. Individually, each organization must also establish its own distinctive identity to differentiate itself from competitors and secure resources. To explore the relationship between differentiation and the consolidation of recognizable identity element clusters, we examine the emergence of organizational form in the early years of the Arizona charter school industry. This industry is particularly interesting for scholars studying institutional processes because the legislative mandate of the new industry was for schools to experiment and provide education in an unconventional manner. Thus, the legislative definition of the organizational form or template for the charter school identity was intentionally underspecified. Using inductive analysis and regression models, we examine the process of identity realization occurring among charter schools and assess how the local institutional context of charter schools affected the realization process. The analyses demonstrate that new industries may come to be characterized by multiple element clusters; a single label for an organizational form may be linked to different combinations of identity elements. Our results also demonstrate that identity realization at the organizational level occurs through mimicry and differentiation processes and is facilitated by the local institutional context. In particular, the diversity of organizational resources available to industry entrepreneurs enables identity differentiation from one's peers."
/doi/10.1287/moor.1100.0450," The notion of a “market” has undergone a paradigm shift with the Internet. Totally new and highly successful markets have been defined and launched by Internet companies, which already form an important part of today's economy and are projected to grow considerably in the future. Another major change is the availability of massive computational power for running these markets in a centralized or distributed manner. In view of these new realities, the study of market equilibria, an important, though essentially nonalgorithmic, theory within mathematical economics, needs to be revived and rejuvenated via an inherently algorithmic approach. Such a theory should not only address traditional market models, but also define new models for some of the new markets. We present a new, natural class of utility functions that allow buyers to explicitly provide information on their relative preferences as a function of the amount of money spent on each good. These utility functions offer considerable expressivity, especially in Google's Adwords market. In addition, they lend themselves to efficient computation, while retaining some of the nice properties of traditional models. The latter include weak gross substitutability, and the uniqueness and continuity of equilibrium prices and utilities."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.23.10.1037," This paper determines an optimal policy for investment in advertising for a firm that wishes to maximize its discounted profits. To that end, an integrated approach consisting of model formulation, empirical investigation, and optimization is carried out. A model of market share response to advertising is formulated as a first-order Markov process, with nonstationary transition probabilities. These probabilities are assumed to be a function of the advertising goodwill accumulated by the firm and its competitors. The model as specified is nonlinear in its parameters, and nonlinear regression techniques are applied to estimate them. It is shown that this nonlinear form offers, via likelihood ratio tests, a unique opportunity for testing the model, and in a resulting empirical test, the model is found to be consistent with the data. Given these empirical findings, an optimal advertising policy is derived by the use of optimal control theory. The managerial implications of the recommended multi-period policy are examined, and the policy's sensitivity to managerial inputs and economic conditions is analyzed and illustrated."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.38.6.778," Although economic activity between the U.S. and Japan has skyrocketed in the last decade, there are few large sample, cross-industry studies analyzing multiple forms of investment by the Japanese in the U.S. This study analyzes the key characteristics of each stage of industry evolution and the costs and benefits of each form of resource investment to predict the patterns of technological linkages, joint ventures, and direct investment of Japanese companies in the U.S. The results find support for a model predicting a predominance of technological linkages in emerging industries, joint ventures in growing industries, and direct investment in maturing industries. Technological linkages are most attractive in emerging industries as firms struggle to acquire technology, information and expertise and share cost and risk, yet retain flexibility. Joint ventures proliferate in growing industries because they offer a means of acquiring and expanding customer bases, yet reducing vulnerability. In maturing industries, where firms' key competencies are more developed, direct investment allows the company to generate demand in new markets without the disadvantage of joint governance."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3455," This paper models how firms or political campaigners (senders) persuade consumers and voters (receivers) by selectively disclosing information about their offering depending on individual receivers' preferences and orientations. We derive positive and normative implications depending on the extent of competition among senders, whether receivers are wary of senders collecting personalized data, and whether firms are able to personalize prices. We show how both senders and receivers can benefit from selective disclosure. Privacy laws requiring senders to obtain consent to acquire personal information that enables such selective disclosure increases receiver welfare if and only if there is little or asymmetric competition among senders, if receivers are unwary, and if firms can price discriminate.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2981," Most research on firm financing studies debt versus equity issuance. We model an alternative source, non-core asset sales, and identify three new factors that contrast it with equity. First, unlike asset purchasers, equity investors own a claim to the firm’s balance sheet (the “balance sheet effect”). This includes the cash raised, mitigating information asymmetry. Contrary to the intuition of Myers and Majluf [Myers SC, Majluf NS (1984) Corporate financing and investment decisions when firms have information that investors do not have. J. Financial Econom. 13(2):187–221], even if non-core assets exhibit less information asymmetry, the firm issues equity if the financing need is high. Second, firms can disguise the sale of low-quality assets—but not equity—as motivated by dissynergies (the “camouflage effect”). Third, selling equity implies a “lemons” discount for not only the equity issued but also the rest of the firm, since both are perfectly correlated (the “correlation effect”).

/doi/10.1287/isre.2017.0745," Health information exchanges (HIEs) are entities that have emerged in healthcare delivery markets across the United States. By providing an interorganizational information system (IOIS) and governance over use of this system and the information exchanged through it, HIEs enable more routine and efficient electronic sharing of patient information between disparate and fragmented healthcare providers. This should result in improved quality and efficiency of care. However, significant questions persist about the extent to which HIEs produce these benefits in practice, particularly in terms of reducing healthcare spending. We use transaction cost economics (TCE) to theorize that HIEs establish a quasi-hierarchy that decreases frictions associated with information sharing in ways that reduce healthcare spending, and that the magnitude of reductions is greater when (1) insurer and provider incentives align, and (2) HIE capabilities mature. We can test these conjectures because HIEs, unlike other efforts that provide IOIS, are typically confined to regional markets and develop heterogeneously between these markets, introducing variation in insurer-provider incentive alignment and HIE maturity. Leveraging a unique national panel data set, we evaluate whether HIEs reduce spending for the largest insurer in the United States, i.e., Medicare, and whether incentives and HIE maturity modify the magnitude of reductions. We find significant spending reductions in healthcare markets that have established operational HIEs, with an average reduction of $139 per Medicare beneficiary per year (1.4% decrease) or a $3.12 billion annual reduction in spending if HIEs were nationally implemented in 2015. We also find that these reductions occur disproportionately in healthcare markets where providers have financial incentives to use an HIE to reduce spending and when HIEs are more mature. Our results inform an important open empirical question in the healthcare domain related to the value of HIEs, while also joining perspectives from TCE with the IOIS literature to understand the factors that may be relevant to IOIS value creation more generally."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.1030.0049," The ownership restructuring of Chinese state-owned enterprises, launched in 1992, has been one of the most radical and far-reaching market-oriented reforms in the Chinese economy. We studied the effects of ownership reform and individuals' collectivist values on rewards-allocation preferences of employees in Chinese state-owned enterprises, and how these relationships were mediated by employees' productivity goal  orientation. We predicted the effects of ownership reform and collectivism on rewards-allocation preferences based on the model of allocation goal priority and the conceptual distinctions of vertical and horizontal collectivism. With data from four pairs of public state-owned enterprises (i.e., listed on the stock market) versus pure state-owned enterprises, we found the following results. First, employees of enterprises that had experienced a greater degree of ownership reform expressed stronger preferences for differential allocation rules (e.g., job position and performance) but weaker preferences for equalitarian allocation rules (e.g., group and individual equality). Second, vertical collectivism was positively related to preferences for differential  allocation rules, but horizontal collectivism was positively related to preferences for equalitarian allocation rules. Third, the effects of both ownership reform and vertical collectivism on differential allocation preferences were mediated by productivity goal orientation. Research and practical implications for ownership reform and vertical-horizontal collectivism are discussed."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0621," It is well known that flexibility can be created in manufacturing and service operations by using multipurpose production sources such as cross-trained labor, flexible machines, or flexible factories. We focus on flexible service centers, such as inbound call centers with cross-trained agents, and model them as parallel queueing systems with flexible servers. We propose a new approach to analyzing flexibility arising from the multifunctionality of sources of production. We create a work sharing (WS) network model for which its average shortest path length (APL) metric can predict the more effective of two alternative cross-training structures in terms of customer waiting times. We show that the APL metric of small world network (SWN) theory is one simple deterministic solution approach to the complex stochastic problem of designing effective workforce cross-training structures in call centers."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2954," We consider the formation of alliances that potentially create complementarities, that is, when the value function is supermodular in firm resources. We show that, in a frictionless world where information is perfect and managers optimize, firm alliances disproportionately increase the value of high-resource-level firms, resulting in higher variance and higher skewness of the distribution of firm value; moreover, higher-value alliances are subject to regression to the mean at a faster rate. These effects are magnified if the degree of complementarities is endogenously determined by each firm’s investment. We also consider alliances where matching and/or information about firm resources are imperfect, and show that complementarities are a necessary but not sufficient condition for alliances to cause an increase in firm value; and that complementarities are neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for alliances to be correlated with higher firm value.

/doi/10.1287/msom.2019.0793," Problem definition : We investigate the impact of nonbinding (wage-irrelevant) goals, set by a manager, on a team of workers with “weak-link” production technology. Can nonbinding goals improve team production when team members face production complementarity? Academic/practical relevance : Nonbinding goals are easy to implement and ubiquitous in practice. These goals have been shown to improve individual performance, but it remains to be seen if such goals are effective in team production when there is production complementarity among workers. Methodology : We first develop a theoretical model where goals act as reference points for workers’ intrinsic motivation to complete the task. We then test our hypotheses in a controlled, human-subjects experiment. In our experiment, participants act as managers or workers, and we examine the impact of nonbinding goals on team outcomes. Results : Consistent with our model, we find evidence that team production does increase when managers are able to set goals. This effect is strongest when goals are challenging but attainable for weak-link workers. However, we also find evidence that many managers assign goals that are too challenging for weak-link workers, resulting in suboptimal team production, lower profits, and higher wasted performance (performance above the weak-link level). Managerial implications : Our analysis indicates that goals are effective motivators in teams, but some managers may have difficulty overcoming personal biases when setting goals. The task of setting team goals is more complex than setting individual goals, and many managers can benefit from training on how to set good goals for the team. Moreover, our finding that suboptimal goals also increase wasted performance suggests that improving goal-setting strategies is especially important in production settings where overperformance is costly for the firm (scrap, energy use, inventory costs, lower prices as a result of oversupply, etc.)."
/doi/10.1287/stsc.2021.0147," We examine how entrepreneurs might build a viable, values-driven niche. Extant templates for niche creation typically employed in moral markets depend on instrumentally rational logics that privilege economic ends such as profitability and efficiency. Entrepreneurs seeking to construct a nascent niche whose purpose and objectives include the amelioration of social ills, however, may find such templates inadequate. Using the emergence of the U.S. bean-to-bar chocolate niche, through which entrepreneurs attempt to address the social and environmental shortcomings of conventional chocolate production, we demonstrate that constructing an alternative model for niche creation is feasible. Most bean-to-bar entrepreneurs deliberately opted out of extant private regulation initiatives, developing instead alternative encompassing, values-driven sourcing and cooperative relationships, which we term collaborative governance. This is enacted throughout the niche by promoting shared values, best practices, and transparency and is supported by strategic meaning-making work to cultivate customers. Together, these three values-driven strategies form a novel template of niche creation based not on cognitive repositioning or exploiting exogenous change within existing structures and institutions, but on a reconceptualization of how markets might work to support the implementation of nonmarket goals. Based on our mixed-methods analysis, we find that, instead of hoping to accomplish nonmarket goals through established market structures, entrepreneurs built a niche centered on the achievement of specific social goals. Our findings suggest that to understand the strategies supporting emergent socially oriented markets, researchers must explore the intersections of values, entrepreneurial motivations, and operational complexities."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.25.9.833," The problem of organization is the problem of obtaining cooperation among a collection of individuals or units who share only partially congruent objectives. When a team of individuals collectively produces a single output, there develops the problem of how to distribute the rewards emanating from that output in such a manner that each team member is equitably rewarded. If equitable rewards are not forthcoming, members will, in future cooperative ventures, adjust their efforts in such a manner that all will be somewhat worse off (cf. Simon [Simon, H. A. 1964. On the concept of organizational goal. Admin. Sci. Quart. 9 (1, June) 1–22.], Marschak [Marschak, Thomas A. 1965. Economic theories of organization. J. G. March, ed. Handbook of Organizations . Rand McNally, Chicago, Ill., 423–450.], Alchian and Demsetz [Alchian, Armen A., Harold Demsetz. 1972. Production, information costs, and economic organization. Amer. Econom. Rev. 62 777–795.). It is the objective of this paper to describe three fundamentally different mechanisms through which organizations can seek to cope with this problem of evaluation and control. The three will be referred to as markets, bureaucracies, and clans. In a fundamental sense, markets deal with the control problem through their ability to precisely measure and reward individual contributions; bureaucracies rely instead upon a mixture of close evaluation with a socialized acceptance of common objectives; and clans rely upon a relatively complete socialization process which effectively eliminates goal incongruence between individuals. This paper explores the organizational manifestations of these three approaches to the problem of control. The paper begins with an example from a parts distribution division of a major company which serves to give some flesh to what might otherwise be overly-abstract arguments. Through the example, each of the three mechanisms is explicated briefly and discussed in terms of two prerequisite conditions, one social and the other informational. The more concrete organization design features of the three forms are considered, along with some consideration of the unique costs accompanying each form."
/doi/10.1287/msom.2019.0813," Operations management has evolved since the founding of M&SOM : new departments have been created in our journals, new tracks have been established in our conferences, and new methodologies have been adopted in our research. Are these changes good for the field? To some, they seem detrimental, yielding a fragmented community that does not always speak the same language nor interact in any meaningful way. Others celebrate our expanded diversity and the new areas of research that it opens up. We argue that neither group is entirely wrong, nor entirely correct. Like the latter, we argue that we must contribute to a growing set of domains using all possible tools of inquiry. But sharing the concern of the former, we view fragmentation as a symptom of a problem. To get out of its rut, to have greater impact, the field needs to ask questions that are important and provide answers that are interesting. In particular, we should (i) avoid the trap of specificity (excellent answers to narrowly defined questions), (ii) expand our horizon beyond our (relatively) small field (connect and actively engage with diverse audiences), and (iii) be bold to pioneer new areas of inquiry. Operations management is at the heart of many of the big issues in society today, and we should be (and can be) central to the conversation."
/doi/10.1287/inte.1070.0282," We trace the evolution of the auto-component supply chain in India beginning with the opening of the economy in 1990 by using a combination of data on firm and sector performance, customer-satisfaction surveys, and interviews with experts. During the past decade, the industry has made remarkable progress on multiple fronts. This is particularly true with regard to quality—10 firms in this industry have won the coveted Deming prize during the past six years. Surprisingly, we first observe that the financial performance of the firms that won the Deming prize (i.e., Deming firms) shows no definitive differences from the performance in the rest of the industry. We then analyze the productivity growth at the firm level across two five-year intervals using a total-factor productivity model. Our results suggest that productivity improved much more during the second period, which is the interval in which most of the firms won the Deming prize. We also analyze the impact of winning the award on profitability and suggest that new firms were able to grow faster in the improving business environment. To “externally” validate our findings, we compare the auto sector in India with that in China. Despite a 10-year disadvantage because of costs that are beyond the control of the firm, the auto sector in India seems to be competitive with that sector in China on all firm-specific factors. In summary, we suggest that firms in this sector have taken the first step by becoming competitive in the areas of cost and quality. We suggest that they are now at a crossroads and must make several choices to leverage these quality gains into a profitable, global supply chain strategy."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2847," We consider a situation in which agents have mutual claims on each other, summarized in a liability matrix. Agents’ assets might be insufficient to satisfy their liabilities, leading to defaults. In case of default, bankruptcy rules are used to specify the way agents are going to be rationed. A clearing payment matrix is a payment matrix consistent with the prevailing bankruptcy rules that satisfies limited liability and priority of creditors. Since clearing payment matrices and the corresponding values of equity are not uniquely determined, we provide bounds on the possible levels equity can take. Unlike the existing literature, which studies centralized clearing procedures, we introduce a large class of decentralized clearing processes. We show the convergence of any such process in finitely many iterations to the least clearing payment matrix. When the unit of account is sufficiently small, all decentralized clearing processes lead essentially to the same value of equity as a centralized clearing procedure. As a policy implication, it is not necessary to collect and process all the sensitive data of all the agents simultaneously and run a centralized clearing procedure.

/doi/10.1287/isre.1120.0466," Given the demand for authentic personal interactions over social media, it is unclear how much firms should actively manage their social media presence. We study this question empirically in a health care setting. We show that active social media management drives more user-generated content. However, we find that this is due to an incremental increase in user postings from an organization's employees rather than from its clients. This result holds when we explore exogenous variation in social media policies, employees, and clients that are explained by medical marketing laws, medical malpractice laws, and distortions in Medicare incentives. Further examination suggests that content being generated mainly by employees can be avoided if a firm's postings are entirely client focused. However, most firm postings seem not to be specifically targeted to clients' interests, instead highlighting more general observations or achievements of the firm itself. We show that untargeted postings like these provoke activity by employees rather than clients. This may not be a bad thing because employee-generated content may help with employee motivation, recruitment, or retention, but it does suggest that social media should not be funded or managed exclusively as a marketing function of the firm."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1112," We consider two-part pricing of a service offered to risk-averse buyers subject to demand uncertainty. Buyers subscribe to the contract before resolution of the uncertainty. Sellers set two-part prices that trade off between insuring buyers against the uncertainty and the ex post deadweight loss from inefficient usage. If marginal and total benefits from the service are positively correlated (a sufficient condition is that the uncertainty not directly affect the buyer benefit), the usage charge should be set above the marginal cost of the service. If marginal and total benefits are negatively correlated, the usage charge should be set below the marginal cost. These results apply whether the seller has market power or is subject to competition. The difference between the profit-maximizing usage charge and marginal cost increases with buyer risk aversion. Our results can be extended to the case of the seller being more risk averse than the buyers. We discuss applications to pricing of beach and ski resorts, lines of credit, utility computing, and government services."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3560," We study the influence of credit default swaps (CDS) trading on the costs of bond intermediation. After CDS initiation, CDS firms pay 12% to 28% (8 to 20 basis points) lower underwriting fees than similar non-CDS firms do. Underwriting fees decline more for riskier issuers and illiquid bonds for which the ability to hedge with CDS is more valuable. In bond offerings, participation by investors facing risk-based regulatory requirements increases after CDS initiation. Our evidence suggests that CDS-driven innovations in risk sharing contribute to the transactional efficiency of the market by reducing the financial intermediation costs of placing bonds.

/doi/10.1287/inte.28.3.144," We developed a dynamic model of HIV transmission to evaluate the costs and benefits of HIV-vaccine programs in a population of homosexual men. We examined how changes in high-risk sexual behavior and the growth pattern of the epidemic influence the cost-effectiveness of preventive vaccines and of therapeutic vaccines. We found that the effect of reductions in condom use is more important for therapeutic vaccines than for preventive vaccines. Therapeutic vaccines may increase HIV seroprevalence in the population, unless the vaccine program is accompanied by increased condom use. Epidemic growth patterns also influence the cost-effectiveness of both vaccines, but the effects are more pronounced for preventive vaccines, which are more cost-effective in an early-stage epidemic than in a late-stage epidemic."

We propose a decentralized algorithm for the users that is based on the history of the price process, where user response to congestion prices is analogous to “fictitious play” in game theory, and show that this results in convergence to the unique Wardrop equilibrium. We further show that the Wardrop equilibrium coincides with the welfare-maximizing capacity allocation."
/doi/10.1287/inte.1050.0158," In 2001, the 6,500+ drivers and conductors of the Dutch railway operator NS Reizigers were very dissatisfied with the structure of their duties, which led to nationwide strikes. However, the successful application of an operations research model supported the development of an alternative set of scheduling rules. This alternative set of rules, called Sharing-Sweet-and-Sour, satisfied the drivers’ and conductors’ requests for more variety in their duties and improved the railway operator’s punctuality and efficiency. The application of the operations research model cut personnel costs by about $4.8 million (1.2 percent) per year. Moreover, we showed that the railway operator could even reduce personnel costs by over $7 million per year."

/doi/10.1287/msom.1120.0416," Gray markets are unauthorized channels of distribution for a supplier's authentic products. We study a distribution channel that consists of a supplier who offers all-unit quantity discounts for batch orders to enjoy cost savings, and a reseller who may divert some goods to the gray markets. We show that the impact of gray markets depends on the reseller's inventory holding cost. When the reseller's inventory holding cost is high, diversion to the gray markets improves the channel performance by enabling the reseller to make batch orders. Because the reseller's order costs decrease through quantity discounts, diversion to the gray markets reduces the resale price and expands sales to the authorized channel. On the other hand, when the reseller's inventory holding cost is low, the reseller would make the batch orders even without the gray markets. In this case the diversion to the gray markets may improve the reseller's performance by shortening the order cycles and reducing the inventory holding costs. Interestingly, because diversion to the gray markets decreases the reseller's cycle inventory volume, the reseller has the reduced incentive to push its inventory, and, consequently, the resale price rises and sales volume decreases in the authorized channel. Moreover, there exists a range of reseller's inventory holding cost and supplier's cost of scale economy such that it is optimal for the supplier to induce reseller's gray market diversion through an all-unit discount. We show that these results are robust when the gray market overlaps with the authorized channel or when the gray market price is sensitive to reseller's diversion volume."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2020.3758," Representative online customer reviews are critical to the effective functioning of the Internet economy. In this study, I investigate the representativeness of online review distributions to examine how extremity bias and conformity impact it and explore whether online review solicitations alter representativeness. Past research on extreme distribution of online ratings commonly relied solely on observed public online ratings. One strength of the current paper is that I observe the private satisfaction ratings of customers regardless of whether they choose to write an online review or not. I show that both extremity bias and conformity exist in unsolicited online word-of-mouth (WOM) and introduce online review solicitations as a mechanism that can partially de-bias ratings. Solicitations increase all customers’ engagement in online WOM, but if solicited, those with moderate experiences increase their engagement more than those with extreme experiences. Consequently, although extremity bias still exists in solicited online WOM, solicitations significantly increase the representativeness of rating distributions. Surprisingly, the results demonstrate that without conformity, unsolicited online WOM would be even less representative of the original customer experiences. Furthermore, I document that both solicited and unsolicited reviews equally overstate the average customer experience (compared with average private ratings) despite stark differences in their rating distributions. Finally, I establish that solicitations for reviews on the company-owned website, on average, decrease the number of one-star reviews on a third-party review platform.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1832," We examine the role of the Indian diaspora in the outsourcing of work to India. Our data are taken from oDesk, the world's largest online platform for outsourced contracts. Despite oDesk minimizing many of the frictions that diaspora connections have traditionally overcome, diaspora connections still matter on oDesk, with ethnic Indians substantially more likely to choose a worker in India. This higher placement is the result of a greater likelihood of choosing India for the initial contract and substantial path dependence in location choices. We further examine wage and performance outcomes of outsourcing as a function of ethnic connections. Our examination of potential rationales for the greater ethnic-based placement of contracts assesses taste-based preferences and information differences.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3567," Do mass media bias content in favor of advertisers? If so, what market conditions limit or exacerbate this bias? We examine the relationship between advertising by auto manufacturers in U.S. newspapers and news coverage of car safety recalls between 2000 and 2014. This context allows us to separate the influence of advertisers, who prefer less coverage, from that of readers, who prefer more information about the safety risks associated with the recalls. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we find that newspapers provide less coverage of recalls issued by manufacturers that advertised more regularly on their pages over the previous two years. The effect is especially pronounced for more severe recalls, which are more likely to hurt manufacturers’ reputations. Competition for readers from other newspapers mitigates proadvertiser bias, and competition for advertising by online platforms exacerbates it. We also present suggestive evidence that less news coverage of recalls is associated with more fatal car accidents. This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0607," This paper examines the subject of cost allocation in a multiple product inventory system, allowing for consolidation of shipments. If we order multiple items using an economic order quantity (EOQ) policy, and consolidate shipments, part of the ordering cost is shared, and part is specific to each item; we want to find the consolidation choice with optimal total cost and divide the cost fairly among the individual items. Such a fair division is central to a costing system in which no group of items subsidizes the others; there are no free riders! We use a cooperative inventory game to determine when this can be done. This game is usually not concave, so we want to know what consolidation combinations determine when this cost can be fairly divided, using the core of the game. We prove that consolidation of all the items is cheaper exactly if there are fair cost allocations (core of the game is not empty), which happens when the portion of the ordering cost common to all items is not too small. We further show how sensitive the nonempty core result is to adjustments in the cost parameters and show how to determine a threshold value for the shared ordering cost, which assures the existence of a fair cost allocation."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2020.3700," The most important rule to determine payments in real-life bankruptcy problems is the proportional rule. Many such bankruptcy problems are characterized by network aspects, and the values of the agents’ assets are endogenous as they depend on the extent to which claims on other agents can be collected. These network aspects make an axiomatic analysis challenging. This paper is the first to provide an axiomatization of the proportional rule in financial networks. Our main axiom is invariance to mitosis. The other axioms are claims boundedness, limited liability, priority of creditors, continuity, and impartiality.

/doi/10.1287/mksc.1070.0351," With $40 billion in annual gross merchandise volume, electronic auctions comprise a substantial and growing sector of the retail economy. Using unique data on Celtic coins, we estimate a structural model of buyer and seller behavior via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with data augmentation. Results indicate that buyer valuations are affected by item, seller, and auction characteristics; buyer costs are affected by bidding behavior; and seller costs are affected by item characteristics and the number of listings. The model enables us to compute fee elasticities even though there is no variation in fees in our data. We find that commission elasticities exceed per item fee elasticities because they target high-value sellers and enhance their likelihood of listing. By targeting commission reductions to high-value sellers, auction house revenues can be increased by 3.9%. Computing customer value, we find that attrition of the largest seller would decrease fees paid to the auction house by $97. Given the seller paid $127 in fees, competitive effects offset only 24% of those fees. In contrast, competition offsets 81% of the buyer attrition effect. In both events, the auction house would overvalue its customers by neglecting competitive effects."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2551," It is widely documented that managers strive to maintain smooth dividends. Yet, it is not clear if this behavior reflects investors’ preferences. In this paper, we study whether investors indeed value dividend-smoothing stocks differently by exploring the implications of dividend smoothing for firms’ investor clientele, stock prices, and cost of capital. We find that retail investors are less likely to hold dividend-smoothing stocks, while institutional investors, and especially mutual funds, are more likely. However, this preference does not result in any detectable relation between the smoothness of a firm’s dividends and the expected return, or market value, of its stock. Together, the evidence suggests that firms adjust the supply of smoothed dividends to match investors’ demand. Dividend smoothing affects the composition of a firm’s shareholders but has little impact on its stock price. This paper was accepted by Amit Seru, finance ."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.1090.0521," Manufacturers often have a choice of whether to advertise something positive about their own products without mentioning their rivals' products (a noncomparative ad) or whether to portray their rivals negatively in addition to promoting their own products (a comparative ad). In this paper we ask: First, if a manufacturer in a distribution channel can choose between a comparative ad and a noncomparative ad, all else being equal, which should it choose? Second, under what conditions would a manufacturer want to reinforce its advertising message at the point of sale with in-store displays, and when should the retailer allow the displays? Third, how does the possibility of in-store displays influence the manufacturer's choice of ad content? We find that a manufacturer will prefer to run comparative ads over noncomparative ads for advertising that is untargeted or that appeals primarily to the manufacturer's core consumers, and run noncomparative ads over comparative ads for advertising that appeals primarily to the rival's core consumers. We also find that in-store displays will be optimal for the manufacturer and its retailers if and only if they increase the overall joint profit of the retailer, the manufacturer, and its rival. Finally, we find that the possibility of offering in-store displays increases a manufacturer's incentive to run noncomparative ads. However, some comparative ads may be so attractive to the manufacturer that it will run them with or without retailer help. Our paper is the first to introduce a channel-based explanation for why manufacturers may or may not want to engage in comparative advertising."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0693," This paper seeks to provide a ranking of information systems in a setting of contingent monitoring. Control strategies that make the acquisition of additional information conditional on observing certain outcomes largely elude the existing ranking criteria. We show that this happens because contingent monitoring involves more than the classical trade-off between risk sharing and incentives; it also requires a balancing of incentives and downside risk. We then develop a refinement of the most common information system orderings that conveys this feature. This allows us to reinterpret and generalize some of the literature's key results concerning, for instance, auditing policies with independent or with correlated signals and monitoring systems where the precision of an added signal is endogenous."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2018.1270," Platform-based technology ecosystems are new forms of organizing independent actors’ innovations around a stable product system. This collective organization is proving superior to traditional, vertically integrated systems in many sectors because of greater “generativity”—the ecosystem’s capacity to foster complementary innovation from autonomous, heterogeneous firms—which extends the usage scope and value of the platform to users. However, greater generativity can also lead to greater variance in the way ecosystem members’ contributions satisfy users’ needs, and it could potentially hinder the ecosystems’ value creation. We draw on collective action theory to examine generativity’s impact on user satisfaction and the mechanisms driving it. We argue that products enhancing user satisfaction contribute to a collective, shared asset, the platform system reputation, from which all participants benefit. Thus, generativity has both a positive (system reputation) and negative (free-riding) effect on the ecosystem members’ incentives for developing products that enhance user satisfaction. We argue that the negative free-riding effect prevails as the platform system matures and competition with alternative platform systems increases. Using data from the video game industry, we find supportive evidence for the free-riding effect, which generates an average loss in total revenue for first-rate games of about $36.5 million and a drop of about 3.3% in the console’s market share. By identifying the conditions that exacerbate free riding in platform ecosystems, our study contributes to the understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of platform ecosystems. It also highlights one feedback mechanism governing collective action in ecosystems and its implications for value creation."
/doi/10.1287/isre.1120.0439," The relationship between information technology (IT) and a key organizational design variable, firm size, is an important area of study, particularly given the ongoing transition to an information-based economy. To better understand the more nuanced aspects of the relationship, we formulated a bidirectional and time-lagged model that incorporates different perspectives from organizational theories and transaction cost economics. Our two models—the bidirectional and one-year lagged model and the bidirectional and two-year lagged model—were tested using nine-year panel data on IT spending, IT stock, coordination costs, firm size, and relevant control variables for 277 manufacturing firms. We found a sequential interaction between IT and firm size in both of the two models: as a firm grows in size, its coordination activities increase; the firm then uses more IT to handle the increased activities of coordination; this increased use of IT, in turn, decreases coordination costs, and eventually, the size of the firm decreases. It was also found that the presence of coordination costs is necessary for the sequential interaction between IT and firm size, indicating coordination between and within firms is a major reason for firms to invest in IT and for IT effect to take place on firm size. This study has taken an initial step by attempting to empirically examine dual causality and longitudinal effects between IT and firm size, and to reconcile different theoretical perspectives on the relationship between them. We hope this work can act as a catalyst for developing a better understanding of the complex relationship between IT and organizations, with the ultimate goal of offering robust prescriptions for successful structural change."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2244," This paper studies the role of family background in explaining differences in the willingness to compete in a cognitive task. By combining data from a lab experiment conducted with a fairly representative sample of adolescents in Norway and high-quality register data on family background, we show that family background is fundamental in two important ways. First, boys from low socioeconomic status families are less willing to compete than boys from better-off families, even when controlling for confidence, performance, risk preferences, time preferences, social preferences, and psychological traits. Second, family background is crucial for understanding the large gender difference in the willingness to compete. Girls are much less willing to compete than boys among children from better-off families, whereas we do not find any gender difference in willingness to compete among children from low socioeconomic status families. Our data suggest that the main explanation of the role of family background is that the father’s socioeconomic status is strongly associated with boys’ willingness to compete. We do not find any association between the willingness to compete for boys or girls and the mother’s socioeconomic status or other family characteristic that may potentially shape competition preferences, including parental equality and sibling rivalry.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1120.1586," The rapid pace of technological innovation necessitates that information technology (IT) services firms continually invest in replenishing the skills of their key asset base, the human capital. We examine whether human capital investments directed toward employee training are effective in improving employee performance. Our rich employee level panel data set affords us the opportunity to link formal training with performance at the individual employee level. Using a dynamic panel model, we identify a significant positive impact of training on employee performance. A unit increase in training is linked to a 2.14% increase in an employee's performance. Interestingly, we find that in the IT sector, skills atrophy and consequently high-experience employees reap higher returns from training, which highlights the uniquely dynamic nature of IT knowledge and skills. We also find that general training that an employee can utilize outside the focal firm improves employee performance. However, specific training pertinent to the focal firm is not positively linked to performance. On the other hand, although domain and technical training both enhance employee performance individually, the interaction between the two suggests a substitutive relationship. Thus, our findings suggest that the value of training is conditional on a focused curricular approach that emphasizes a structured competency development program. Our findings have both theoretical and practical significance. Most important, they justify increased human capital investments to fuel future growth in this important component of the global economy. This paper was accepted by Lorin Hitt, information systems."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1877," We conduct a laboratory experiment to study how advice by a more experienced and better-informed person affects an individual's entry into a real-effort tournament and the gender gap. Our experiment is motivated by the concerns raised by approaching the gender gap through affirmative action policies. Overall, advice improves the entry decision of subjects, in that forgone earnings due to wrong entry decisions go significantly down. The improvements are mainly driven by increased entry of strong-performing women, who also become more confident, and reduced entry of weak-performing men. We find that the overall gender gap persists even though it disappears among low and strong performers. The persistence is due to an emerging gender gap among intermediate performers driven by women (men) following more the advice to stay out of (enter) the tournament in this performance group.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2482," This paper studies whether and how the contractual horizon of venture capital funds affects their investments in innovative firms. I find that funds with a longer remaining horizon select younger companies at an earlier stage of their development, which grow their patent stock significantly more than companies financed by funds with a shorter horizon. The sensitivity of investment decisions to horizon is stronger among experienced venture capital firms, who allocate investments across a larger number of fund vintages. Finally, I find that the interaction of funds’ fixed horizon with their option-like compensation structure affects their investment decisions: when early performance has been high, fund managers target less innovative companies. These findings shed light on the drivers of venture capital investment decisions and on their implications for the type of companies that receive venture capital financing.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1030.0195," This paper analyzes the relationship between investment in information and communication technologies (ICT), non-ICT investment, labor productivity, and workplace reorganization. Firms are assumed to reorganize workplaces if the productivity gains arising from workplace reorganization exceed the associated reorganization costs. Two different types of organizational change are considered: enhancement group work and flattening of hierarchies. Empirical evidence is provided for a sample of 411 firms from the German business-related services sector. We develop and estimate a model for labor productivity and firms' decision to reorganize workplaces that allows workplace reorganization to affect any parameter of the labor productivity equation. Our general and flexible methodology allows us to properly take account of strategic complementarities between the input factors and workplace reorganization. The estimation results show that changes in human resources practices do not significantly affect firms' output elasticities with respect to ICT, non-ICT capital, and labor, although most of the point estimates of the individual output elasticities and of the control variables for observable firm heterogeneity are larger if workplace reorganization is realized. We therefore apply the Kernel density-estimation technique and demonstrate that for firms with organizational change, the entire labor productivity distribution shifts significantly out to the right if workplace reorganization takes place, indicating that workplace reorganization induces an increase in labor productivity that is attributable to complementarities between the various input factors and workplace reorganization. By contrast, firms without organizational change would not have realized significant productivity gains if they had reorganized workplaces."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1120.1644," This paper assesses the validity and accuracy of firms' backward patent citations as a measure of knowledge flows from public research by employing a newly constructed data set that matches patents to survey data at the level of the research and development lab. Using survey-based measures of the dimensions of knowledge flows, we identify sources of systematic measurement error associated with backward citations to both patent and nonpatent references. We find that patent citations reflect the codified knowledge flows from public research, but they appear to miss knowledge flows that are more private and contract based in nature, as well as those used in firm basic research. We also find that firms' patenting and citing strategies affect patent citations, making citations less indicative of knowledge flows. In addition, an illustrative analysis examining the magnitude and direction of measurement error bias suggests that measuring knowledge flows with patent citations can lead to substantial underestimation of the effect of public research on firms' innovative performance. Throughout our analyses we find that nonpatent references (e.g., journals, conferences, etc.), not the more commonly used patent references, are a better measure of knowledge originating from public research.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1381," We analyze how entrepreneurial opportunity cost conditions performance. Departing from the common practice of using survival as a measure of entrepreneurial performance, we model both failure and cash-out (liquidity event) as conditioned by the same underlying process. High-opportunity-cost entrepreneurs prefer a shorter time to success, even if this also implies failing more quickly, whereas entrepreneurs with fewer outside alternatives will choose less aggressive strategies and, consequently, linger on longer. We formalize this intuition with a simple model. Using a novel data set of information security start-ups, we find that entrepreneurs with high opportunity costs are not only more likely to cash out more quickly but are also more likely to fail faster. Not only is survival a poor indicator of performance, but its use as one obscures the relationship between entrepreneurial characteristics, entrepreneurial strategies, and outcomes.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.1090.1016," Why do firms use continuations in the prosecution of their patents? Motivated by the widespread use of continuations by U.S. firms and the prominence of this procedure in U.S. patent policy debates, we investigate the influence of corporate and patent characteristics on the use of continuations. We employ novel data on applicants and their filings of three types of continuations—the continuation application (CAP), the continuations in part (CIP), and divisions—during 1981–2000 to distinguish among the motives for continuing patents. We find that CIPs are disproportionately filed by research and development-intensive firms that patent heavily, and that these continuations are more common in chemical and biological technologies. Patents issuing from CIPs cover relatively important inventions and their use appears consistent with a strategy of protecting “pioneering inventions.” In contrast, CAPs and divisions are associated with less important patents assigned to capital-intensive firms, particularly in computer and semiconductor fields, and appear to be used in defensive patenting strategies. We analyze the effects of the 1995 change in patent term, and find that the act reduced continuations overall and shifted the output of continuations toward less important patents."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2688," A growing empirical literature uses patent citations as a quality-adjusted measure for innovation, despite concerns about the validity of this measure. This paper links patents with objective measures of improvements in the quality of patented inventions—measured through performance in field trials for hybrid corn—to examine three potential factors that influence citations: (1) improvements in performance, (2) citing practices of patent attorneys, and (3) citing practices of patent examiners. This analysis reveals that citations are robustly correlated with performance, which confirms that citations are a useful quality-adjusted measure for innovation. The citing practices of patent attorneys and examiners, however, also influence citations. Patent attorneys cite early patents, which help establish the patentability of an invention; this practice may inflate citation counts for early patents, particularly for inventions that have only recently become patentable. Attorneys also add self-citations; our analysis indicates that self-citations are an indicator of follow-on invention. By comparison, examiner-added citations are typically unrelated to improvements in performance or follow-on invention.

/doi/10.1287/orsc.1070.0264," Applying a new theoretical and empirical approach to intrafirm knowledge transfers, this paper provides some initial insight to the little-researched phenomenon of why some subsidiaries are isolated from knowledge-transfer activities within the multinational corporation (MNC). Knowledge transfer is framed as a problemistic search process initiated by the recipient unit. We show that knowledge flows from units that are perceived to be highly capable to units that perceive themselves to be highly capable. Knowledge flows are also associated with existing levels of communication and reciprocity. Taken together, these findings suggest that knowledge transfers in MNCs typically occur between highly capable members of an “in crowd,” and the isolated minority rarely, if ever, engages in knowledge-sharing activities. Finally, we show that the isolated minority underperforms other subsidiaries, suggesting the possibility of a “liability of internal isolation.”"

/doi/10.1287/orsc.2018.1220," This study develops and tests a conceptual framework that analyzes how and why a firm’s experiences with complex intraorganizational structures (i.e., matrix) will affect its propensity to enter into, and ability to manage, complex interorganizational structures (i.e., alliances that are multilateral, multifunctional, or involve diverse industry partners). We posit that managers of matrix firms’ greater familiarity with coordination, knowledge sharing, and conflict management challenges in intraorganizational collaboration gives them greater confidence in their ability to manage similar challenges in complex alliances. Using a combination of quantitative data analysis and semistructured interviews, we find support for our core prediction that matrix firms are more likely than nonmatrix firms to enter into complex alliances. Unexpectedly, we find that the stock market penalizes matrix firms that engage in multifunctional alliances, a phenomenon we suggest reflects a “double-complexity discount.” The double-complexity discount refers to reduced organizational outcomes incurred for the simultaneous complexity of intra- and interorganizational governance structures. This study raises questions about the benefits and costs of firms’ simultaneously engaging in complex intra- and interorganizational governance structures, with particular attention to the difference between managerial confidence and competence regarding complex collaboration challenges.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2339," This paper analyzes the substantially growing markets for crowdfunding, in which retail investors lend to borrowers without financial intermediaries. Critics suggest that these markets allow sophisticated investors to take advantage of unsophisticated investors. The growth and viability of these markets critically depend on the underlying incentives. We provide evidence of perverse incentives in crowdfunding that are not fully recognized by the market. In particular, we look at group leader bids in the presence of origination fees and find that these bids are (wrongly) perceived as a signal of good loan quality, resulting in lower interest rates. Yet these loans actually have higher default rates. These adverse incentives are overcome only with sufficient skin in the game and when there are no origination fees. The results from the analysis in this paper provide more general implications for crowdfunding, its structure, and its regulation. This paper was accepted by Wei Jiang, finance ."

We demonstrate the advantages of our approach in data experiments and apply the model to aggregate search and choice data from the camcorder product category at Amazon.com.

Instead, managers of cartel firms enjoy greater job security, receive higher cash bonuses, and more aggressively take profits from appreciated stock option awards. Legal sanctions against individual managers are infrequent, with enforcement actions focused on corporations rather than their officers. Managers seem to use concealment strategies actively to limit detection of cartel membership by their boards and auditors. This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting."
/doi/10.1287/opre.2021.2138," Cloud computing has motivated renewed interest in resource allocation problems with new consumption models. A common goal is to share a resource, such as CPU or I/O bandwidth, among distinct users with different demand patterns as well as different quality of service requirements. To ensure these service requirements, cloud offerings often come with a service level agreement (SLA) between the provider and the users. A SLA specifies the amount of a resource a user is entitled to utilize. In many cloud settings, providers would like to operate resources at high utilization while simultaneously respecting individual SLAs. There is typically a trade-off between these two objectives; for example, utilization can be increased by shifting away resources from idle users to “scavenger” workload, but with the risk of the former then becoming active again. We study this fundamental tradeoff by formulating a resource allocation model that captures basic properties of cloud computing systems, including SLAs, highly limited feedback about the state of the system, and variable and unpredictable input sequences. Our main result is a simple and practical algorithm that achieves near-optimal performance on the above two objectives. First, we guarantee nearly optimal utilization of the resource even if compared with the omniscient offline dynamic optimum. Second, we simultaneously satisfy all individual SLAs up to a small error. The main algorithmic tool is a multiplicative weight update algorithm and a primal-dual argument to obtain its guarantees. We also provide numerical validation on real data to demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in practical applications."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.1040.0109," Almost universally, research and practice suggest that a brand that increases its product assortment, or variety, should benefit through increased market share. In this paper, we show this is not always the case. We introduce the construct “assortment type” and demonstrate that the effect of assortment size on brand share is systematically moderated by assortment type. We define an “alignable” assortment as a set of brand variants that differ along a single, compensatory dimension such that choosing from that assortment only requires within-attribute trade-offs. In contrast, we define a “nonalignable” assortment as a set of brand variants that simultaneously vary along multiple, noncompensatory dimensions, demanding between-attribute trade-offs. In turn, we argue that an alignable assortment can efficiently meet the diverse tastes of consumers, thereby increasing brand share, but that a nonalignable assortment increases both the cognitive effort and the potential for regret faced by a consumer, thereby decreasing brand share. We term this effect “overchoice.” Across three studies, we provide evidence of overchoice and tie the effect to the effort and regret brought about by nonalignability. In the process, we demonstrate that simplification of information presentation, reversibility of choice, and a reduction in underlying nonalignability serve to reduce or eliminate this effect."

Our result implies the indexability of a new class of restless bandit models."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.14.5.558.16769," Mainstream organizational research is based on science and the humanities. Science helps us to understand organized systems, from an outsider position, as empirical objects. The humanities contribute to understanding, and critically reflecting on, the human experience of actors inside organized practices. This paper argues that, in view of the persistent relevance gap between theory and practice, organization studies should be broadened to include design as one of its primary modes of engaging in research. Design is characterized by its emphasis on solution finding, guided by broader purposes and ideal target systems. Moreover, design develops, and draws on, design propositions that are tested in pragmatic experiments and grounded in organization science. This study first explores the main differences and synergies between science and design, and explores how and why the design discipline has largely moved away from academia to other sites in the economy. The argument then turns to the genealogy of design methodologies in organization and management studies. Subsequently, this paper explores the circular design methodology that serves to illustrate the nature of design research, that is, the pragmatic focus on actionable knowledge as well as the key role of ideal target systems in design processes. Finally, the author proposes a framework for communication and collaboration between the science and design modes, and argues that scholars in organization studies can guide human beings in the process of designing and developing their organizations toward more humane, participative, and productive futures. In this respect, the organization discipline can make a difference."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2478," As public firms exploit their growth opportunities following their initial public offering, their assets in place increase, and they organize themselves optimally to operate these assets efficiently, which requires a more formal and less flexible organization than to generate new growth opportunities. Our theory predicts that, as a result of these inflexibilities, firms fail to fully replace their growth opportunities, so that their Tobin’s q falls with age and they invest less as they grow older. With our theory, competition in the market for corporate control and capital markets monitoring increase the rate of decrease in Tobin’s q , while product and labor market competition slow it down. We find empirical support for these predictions. We also find evidence that the decline in q is related to firm rigidities.

/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2018.3278," We develop a model in which reward-based crowdfunding enables firms to obtain a reliable proof of concept early in their production cycle: they learn about total demand from a limited sample of target consumers preordering a new product. Learning from the crowdfunding sample creates a valuable real option because firms invest only if updated expectations about total demand are sufficiently high. This is particularly valuable for firms facing a high degree of uncertainty about consumer preferences, such as developers of innovative consumer products. Learning also enables firms to overcome moral hazard. The higher the funds raised, the lower the firms’ incentives to divert them, provided third-party platforms limit the sample size by restricting campaign length. Although the probability of campaign success decreases with sample size, the expected funds raised are maximized at an intermediate sample size. Our results are consistent with stylized facts and lead to new empirical implications. This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.2014.0931," This paper investigates the knowledge influences of the ethnic community on the quality of innovations of Indian immigrant inventors in the U.S. semiconductor industry. Membership in the Indian ethnic community enables inventors to source knowledge from, and to collaborate with, others in the community. By analyzing patent data, we find that the utility of ethnic knowledge and collaborators depends on the level of inventor embeddedness in the community. Most inventors benefit by sourcing knowledge from, or collaborating with, other Indians and hence enhance innovation quality, but at a diminishing rate. For those who are very heavily embedded in the community, ethnic community knowledge decreases the quality of innovation. Our results provide some support for the idea that simultaneously sourcing ethnic knowledge and using ethnic collaborators also decreases innovativeness. Thus, for Indian inventors, the level of embeddedness in the community is a key factor in influencing the quality of innovation."

We show that consulting the agent was beneficial to principals as long as they followed the agent's choice. Ignoring the agent's choice was detrimental to the principal because it engendered negative emotions and low levels of transfers. Nevertheless, the majority of principals were reluctant to change their mind and adopt the agent's proposal.

/doi/10.1287/orsc.2017.1191," In response to recent calls for theory to predict and explain the phenomenon of “meta-organizations,” we set out to identify the causes of their formation. Using a cross-case comparison of multiple case studies in sub-Saharan Africa, where nine focal firms varied in their response to the complexities of sustainability, we examined how and why some firms approached sustainability through a meta-organization while others did not. Our findings show that meta-organizations may be an effective means of managing the complexity of sustainability when participants exhibit an openness to innovative forms of collaboration—which, in turn, rests on complex systems framing and experiential embeddedness—and when they collectively undergo a four-stage process of meta-organization formation that transforms dormant resources into critical sources for achieving systemic goals. Our results also suggest that meta-organizations may be particularly well suited to addressing institutional and market voids, which typically constitute highly complex economic and social contexts. In addition to making contributions to the extant literature on interorganizational relationships and networks, this paper, to our knowledge, is the first to examine the appropriateness of the meta-organizational form in less developed economies, extending the potential generalizability of its application to multiple economic contexts."
/doi/10.1287/mksc.2021.1287," We study the estimation of preference heterogeneity in markets in which consumers engage in costly search to learn product characteristics. Costly search amplifies the way consumer preferences translate into purchase probabilities, generating a seemingly large degree of preference heterogeneity. We develop a search model that allows for flexible preference heterogeneity and estimate its parameters using a unique panel data set on consumers’ search and purchase behavior. The results reveal that when search costs are ignored, the model overestimates standard deviations of product intercepts by 53%. We show that the bias in heterogeneity estimates leads to incorrect inference about price elasticities and seller markups and has important consequences for personalized pricing."

/doi/10.1287/mksc.1040.0084," Conventional wisdom suggests that one of the goals of manufacturer advertising is to reduce the cross-price elasticity between products (make one's own and rivals' products appear to be less substitutable in the eyes of consumers). Conventional wisdom also suggests that, all else being equal, retailers will be able to obtain better terms of trade from manufacturers the more substitutable are the manufacturers' products. It follows that retailers should be opposed to advertising that has the effect of reducing cross-price elasticities and thus that manufacturer advertising can be a source of channel conflict. We show that these conventional wisdoms need not hold when only some consumers are exposed to the advertising messages. Using a Hotelling model of demand, we show that (1) manufacturers can be worse off from advertising that reduces the cross-price elasticities between their products, (2) channel conflict need not arise, even when the sole purpose of advertising is to affect cross-price elasticities, and (3) depending on its bargaining power, a retailer can be better off when the manufacturers' products are perceived to be less substitutable."

We document a positive relation between abnormal trading volume, future investment expenditures, and financing cash flows.

The analysis supports the view that inventors with a scientific education are more likely to generate patents that span technological boundaries (in our case, 30 broad, top-level technological domains) than inventors with an engineering degree. A doctoral degree is associated with increased recombination breadth for all groups of inventors. The breadth of an inventor's technological recombinations diminishes with increasing temporal distance to his education, but the differences between scientists and engineers persist over time. Our findings provide several new insights for research on inventors, the literature on organizational learning and innovation, and strategy research.

/doi/10.1287/mksc.2020.1258," A central challenge in estimating the causal effect of television (TV) advertising on demand is isolating quasirandom variation in advertising. Political advertising, which topped $14 billion in expenditures in 2016, has been proposed as a plausible source of such variation and thus, a candidate for an instrumental variable (IV). We provide a critical evaluation of how and where this instrument is valid and useful across categories. We characterize the conditions under which political cycles theoretically identify the causal effect of TV advertising on demand, highlight threats to the exclusion restriction and monotonicity condition, and suggest a specification to address the most serious concerns. We test the strength of the first-stage category by category for 274 product categories. For most categories, weak-instrument robust inference is recommended, as first-stage F statistics are less than 10 for 221 of 274 product categories in our benchmark specification. The largest first-stage F statistics occur in categories that typically advertise locally, such as automobile dealerships and restaurants. Failure to use the suggested specification leads to results that suggest violations of exclusion and monotonicity in a significant number of categories. Finally, we conduct a case study of the auto industry. Despite a very strong first stage, the IV estimate for this category is imprecise."
/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2876," We examine the effects of postcrisis financial regulation, encompassing the Dodd–Frank Act and Basel III, on market liquidity of the U.S. fixed-income market. We estimate structural breaks in a large panel of liquidity measures of corporate and Treasury bonds. Our methodology does not require a priori knowledge of the timing of breaks, can capture not only sudden jumps but also breaks in slow-moving trends, and displays excellent power properties. Against the popular claim that postcrisis regulation hurt liquidity, we find no evidence of liquidity deterioration during periods of regulatory intervention. Instead, breaks toward higher liquidity are often detected. The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2876. This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance."
/doi/10.1287/orsc.1070.0272," This study examines the interaction between change-minded human agents and environmental and organizational contingencies to understand contested change in highly institutionalized practices. We propose a theory of how individuals, including those who are structurally highly embedded, can become change agents when confronted with amplified institutional contradictions. Using the empirical example of family presence in the leadership of Taiwanese business groups, we argue that despite the structural constraints on second-generation key leaders, these leaders are more likely to actualize their motivation to reduce family presence in the contexts of market-oriented transition and highly diversified business groups, and that key leaders with a management education from the United States are more likely to deviate from this institutionalized practice than are non-U.S.-educated key leaders, because they can transport ideas from different business models. A longitudinal analysis of the top 100 business groups in Taiwan between 1977 and 1998 largely supports our arguments. This study contributes to recent endeavors to understand antecedents to institutional change with an explicit focus on the interplay between agency and context, and to business-group research by examining the change of one foundational feature of the group form."
/doi/10.1287/isre.2018.0779," Multihoming, the decision to design a complement to operate on multiple platforms, is becoming increasingly common in many platform markets. Perceived wisdom suggests that multihoming is beneficial for complement providers as they expand their market reach, but it reduces differentiation among competing platforms as the same complements become available on different platforms. We argue that complement providers face trade-offs when designing their products for multiple platform architectures—they must decide how far to specialize the complement to each platform’s technological specifications. Because of these trade-offs, multihoming complements can have different quality performance across platforms. In a study of the U.S. video game industry, we find that multihoming games have lower-quality performance on a technologically more complex console than on a less complex one. Also, games designed for and released on a focal platform have lower-quality performance on platforms they are subsequently multihomed to. However, games that are released on the complex platform with a delay suffer a smaller drop in quality on complex platforms. This has important implications for platform competition, and for managers considering expanding their reach through multihoming.
