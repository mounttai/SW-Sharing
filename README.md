# SW-Sharing


Materials used in the online sharing session about Sharing Economy for [Shine Wing International](
http://www.shinewinginternational.com) and their clients, including:

* the slides deck
* code to generate the wind clouds on slide 5

Structure of the folder:

* all python code are store in the main directory
* the "data" directory hosts one file about the meta information of all papers, as well as a subdirectory "abstract" which includes the abstracts of all papers.
* the "results" directory hosts the word clouds used in the slides

By searching "sharing economy", we get 6,871 papers from INFORMS.org. The majority of them are valid papers. A few are editorial comments, information on authors, etc., and are excluded in the code.
